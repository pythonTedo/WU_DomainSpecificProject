volcom;Richard Woolcott and Tucker Hall, set off on a snowboard trip that would forever change their lives. Tucker had just been laid off from work but that wouldn’t stop him from attending his routine Tahoe trip to visit Nathan Fletcher and Mark Gabriel. After riding four days of fresh powder, Richard called work with the excuse that they were snowed in and extended his stay. For more than a week, they awoke every morning with two new feet of snow. It was their first real experience riding powder and the new obsession wouldn't stop there. Two weeks later Richard quit his job to take some time off and snowboard. He and Tucker had also talked of starting a clothing company during the Tahoe trip but nothing was really finalized. Later that spring, the two came up with the idea of starting a riding company based around the three sports they enjoyed (snowboarding, skateboarding and surfing). With an initial $5,000 from Richard's dad, they started the process. First came the name, then came the stone and Volcom was born. Volcom was a family of people not willing to accept the establishment suppressing their passion for boardsports. This was a time when snowboarding and skateboarding was looked down upon and the U.S. was in a recession with riots in Los Angeles and the Gulf War breaking out. Much like today, change was in the air. Richard and Tucker traveled around the world on wild journeys with friends riding whatever they could. The business side of things was minimal. The headquarters were set up in Newport Beach in Richard's bedroom and all sales were run out of Tucker's bedroom in Huntington Beach. The two knew nothing about how to make clothes, but that didn't matter, it was all about spirit and creativity. Clothing sales for the first year were $2,600. Since those wild beginnings, the Volcom Stone has spread slowly across the world. The company has matured internally, but the same philosophy and ethos that spawned the brand continues to fuel the Volcom thinking that flows through its art, music, films, athletes and clothing today.
ements;When I was a baby, my first word was — Ementa. In 2007, I met ten babies wearing large T-shirts. Each T-shirt had one letter — FRIENDSHIP They turned around, I read — SKATEBOARD These babies were artists — very abstract artists, They painted with laughter, love and imagination. Their paintings came in different shapes and sizes, Some were shaped as Jeans — others as Jackets. They started to paint a book — with colorful words, Their words have texture and their textures rhyme. Sixteen years later — our babies are still writing, A book about our lives, to be sent into cosmos.

nitro;Time flies – and quite honestly, we had no idea where Nitro would be after more than 34 years when we started working on the first product line in 1989 and finally founded the brand in 1990. We were just stoked that snowboarding had already come this far at that point and we’d actually be running our own snowboard company. Being able to dream up whatever board you wanted and seeing it come alive was the biggest thrill – and still is today. It may sound pathetic, but it still gets us stoked to see someone using one of our products and to realize this person has spent his hard-earned money on a piece of equipment we have designed and produced. Being a privately owned company, everyone at Nitro can focus 100% on product we truly believe in. We are only responsible to our customers, team riders and our own instincts, not to some anonymous investors. We take this responsibility quite seriously and will continue to do what we did with for more than 30 years: Put our dreams into reality and make sure that our customers feel the same joy and excitement riding as we had designing and testing.
