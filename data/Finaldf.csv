By the late 1990s, the notoriety of The North Face’s attire meant that its customer pool expanded beyond those merely looking for technical clothing and entered the lives of rappers and various other subcultural stylings; for instance, the North Face’s Tech Steep jacket featured in Wu-Tang’s Method Man music video in 1993.

That withstanding, the fashion and music scene remains only a small part of the company’s business, with it focusing more intently on creating advancements within outerwear and equipment for serious hikers and climbers.

Inspired by the vision of Creative Director Stuart Vevers and the inclusive and courageous spirit of our hometown, we make beautiful things, crafted to last—for you to be yourself in. Coach began with a dream to hand-craft leather into beautiful, clever, practical things. Founded in New York in 1941 by six artisans, the house grew under the vision of Lillian and Miles Cahn to become the Original American House of Leather.

Then came Bonnie Cashin: hired by Miles Cahn in 1962 to be Coach’s first lead designer. With Bonnie’s fearless vision of color, proportion and quirk—and her love of doing—Coach transformed into the perfect reflection of modern freedom and equality, the attitude of 60s New York.

In the decades that followed, Coach opened its first store on Madison Avenue and transformed from a family-run leathergoods company into a fashion house known around the world for its distinct attitude and lifestyle collections inspired by New York.

Today, as in 1941, we are shaped by our unique story—and committed, in everything we do, to celebrating craft, our hometown and the optimism of authentic American style.

Since being founded in 1856, Burberry has been guided by the core belief that Creativity Opens Spaces. From developing outerwear that allowed daring men and women to surpass the limits of human endeavour to being a luxury pioneer in the digital space, our purpose is to unlock the power of imagination to push boundaries and open new possibilities for our people, our customers and our communities. Thomas Burberry was just 21 years old when he founded his outfitting business in Basingstoke, England. However, it was in 1879 that he secured his legacy as a visionary and innovator with his invention of gabardine. Before the advent of the fabric, outerwear worn to protect against the often inclement British weather tended to be made from rubber, oil and wax. After hearing from a doctor that it was better to get wet through rather than stay dry in such clothing as it was odorous, hot and believed to induce ill-health, Thomas Burberry set out to create a breathable and weatherproof alternative. His invention, gabardine, revolutionised rainwear. The open spaces in the weave of the fabric allowed airflow and made for lightweight and comfortable garments. 

Such was the fabric’s reputation that in 1893 Norwegian polar explorer, zoologist and recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, Dr Fridtjof Nansen, took Burberry gabardine with him when he set sail bound for the Arctic Circle. Many more explorers and adventurers turned to Burberry gabardine in the years that followed. Gabardine is still used in the manufacture of Burberry Heritage Trench Coats today. 

Affectionately known as “Old Tom”, Thomas Burberry was described by his employees as “the kindest of chiefs”. During his lifetime he devoted significant time to humanitarian causes and gave generously to local charities. He was considered to have been thoughtful and ambitious, and was said to have conducted his career through “straightforward dealings and sound principles”. 

He retired in 1917 but remained on the Board of Burberrys Ltd until his death in 1926 at the age of 90.

The brand traces its roots to a bespoke shoemaker named Jimmy Choo, based in the East End of London in the early 1990s, who catered to the global jet set, including Princess Diana. The Jimmy Choo company was founded in 1996, with Mr Choo’s niece, Sandra Choi, who had been heading up design in the East End atelier, coming on board as Creative Director, a position she holds to this day. Mr Choo departed the company in 2001.

The sexy cut, fashionable design, and exceptional Italian craftsmanship struck a chord with a sophisticated clientele, and the first collection enjoyed immediate success. With a goal of creating a global luxury business, Jimmy Choo attracted outside investment and the company embarked on a significant expansion across product categories, channels and geographies.

A pioneer in the art of celebrity dressing, Jimmy Choo was among the first to bring shoes and handbags to Hollywood where the red carpet proved to be the ideal runway for the brand. Today, Jimmy Choo can be seen on style icons from celebrities to royalty, musicians to heads of state.

The brand’s reputation as a celebrity favourite helped to fuel its rapid expansion. Its iconography was further defined by the bold and dramatic advertising portraying glamorous but strong women in towering heels and luxurious handbags, captured by some of the most acclaimed fashion photographers in the world.

Retail development has been integral to the company’s strategy. The first Jimmy Choo store was opened in 1996 on Motcomb Street in London, complementing a distribution in some of the most prestigious multi-brand stores in the world. Two years later, the company expanded to the US, opening two stores in New York City and Beverly Hills. International expansion continued with Jimmy Choo securing locations in the premiere luxury shopping destinations of the world’s most prestigious cities including Sloane Street and Bond Street in London, Avenue Montaigne in Paris, Via Condotti in Rome, Madison Avenue in New York, Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, and Ginza in Tokyo.

Jimmy Choo encompasses a complete luxury accessories brand. Women’s shoes remain the core of the product offer, alongside handbags, small leather goods, scarves, sunglasses, eyewear, belts, fragrance and men’s shoes. Creative Director Sandra Choi has been with the brand since its inception in 1996 with a vision to create one of the world’s most treasured luxury brands. Jimmy Choo has a global store network encompassing more than 200 stores and is present in the most prestigious department and specialty stores worldwide. Jimmy Choo is part of the Capri Holdings Limited global fashion luxury group publicly listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker CPRI.

We have also promoted the inherent beauty of denim by creating washes and treatments that bring out its unique characteristics and qualities. Today’s sophisticated washings palette represents a full life-story, from raw, unwashed denim through deep indigo dyed to extreme bleached, with treatments adding multiple gradations of wear to create distinctive, textured garments with soul. G-Star is focused on the innovation of denim. When we design, we design for the future; not only in how our products look, but also the wider impact they have. If we still want to be here as a denim brand in 20, 50 or even 100 years from now, it is crucial for us to think innovatively about the impact we have on people and the planet.

For G-Star, this means future-proofing denim by investing in sustainable innovation and incorporating it in everything we do. We focus on a circular approach to how denim is made and used by our customer to create tomorrow's classics: quality denim of the future with respect for people & planet in a transparent manner.

René doesn’t win but he had the determination of the crocodile on court, which is why an American journalist gave him this nickname. The crocodile becomes a symbol
The crocodile takes shape in 1927 under the pen of designer Robert George. An early fan of customization, René Lacoste immediately has it embroidered on his blazers. A few years later, the polo sees the light of day. The crocodile over the heart makes Lacoste the first brand to display a visible logo on an article of clothing.",https://www.lacoste.com

He and tailor Jacob Davis combined copper rivet reinforcements with tough denim, leading to the first manufactured waist overalls in 1873. Today, we call them ""blue jeans."" What started as an invention for the American worker became the uniform of progress.

He is an entrepreneur, an award-winning designer, a business titan, and a family man. The eponymous shoe designer is also the subject of the documentary film, MADDMAN: The Steve Madden Story on Netflix. A movie that delves into the man who built a booming brand and nearly lost it to “The Wolf of Wall Street,” only to rebound with a global empire. He’s endured failures and of course successes without forgetting his humble beginnings or his core consumer, resulting in millions of adoring fans worldwide. Considered the fashion footwear mogul of the 21st century, Madden has an innate sense of what’s hot, what’s next, what’s exciting and more importantly, how this will translate to the customer. Inspired by rock and roll, fused with a jolt of sex appeal and urban edge, Madden creates shoes that are innovative, fun, sometimes wild and always spot-on-chic. In 1990 with a mere $1,100 in the bank, Madden swiftly followed his intuition to create the next big trend, anticipate consumer needs and subsequently deliver collections that were both cutting edge and highly saleable. Channeling his creative energy to produce a variety of silhouettes and vibrant styles in his Queens-based factory, quickly his dream became reality and the Steve Madden brand was born.

The prolific designer’s expertise in trend forecasting has propelled him to the top of his field. Relying on sheer instinct, he transformed a footwear relic into a phenomenon when he introduced a new amped up platform shoe at the launch of his company. Inspired by rock stars of the 70s, Madden’s now famous chunky platform shoes were one of the biggest success stories of the time and became a hallmark to the brand. With his finger on the pulse of pop culture, Madden says, “What inspires me is what I see people wearing on the streets of the world from New York to London and beyond. I get my ideas and inspiration from pounding the pavement.”

There are no products matching the selection. The fusion of style and music remains at Madden’s core: “Music is in the DNA of what I do.” As with fashion and design, Madden has an eye and ear for emerging talent, which led to the creation of Steve Madden Music, an integrated marketing platform that promotes music artists through a multitude of media, consumer channels and live performances. As such, he has collaborated with stars including Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Ellie Goulding, Iggy Azalea, Santigold, Tove Lo, Jason Derulo, The Kills, Tori Kelly, Halsey, and Cardi B, all while on their rise to fame. With the continuing success and the consistent growth of the Steve Madden Music platform, Steve decided to expand on his love for music and launched 5Towns Records in 2016.

On a philanthropic note, Steve Madden is continuing to shine a light on those in need of a second chance by supporting a variety of organizations in that genre, while also helping to mentor young entrepreneurs around the country with the newly launched “Self Made” company initiative.

The business prospered, and a new shop was opened in Via Piave in 1932. The couple's five daughters went to work for the firm. German designer Karl Lagerfeld joined Fendi in 1965. Lagerfeld immediately created the inverted FF logo that joined the growing list of international status symbols, and then set about, aided and abetted by the sisters, to revolutionize the treatment of fur and other clothing. Marvin Traub, president of Bloomingdale's, discovered Fendi's leather goods and introduced them to the United States. In 1969 Fendi presented its first ready-to-wear fur collection at Palazzo Pitti in Florence. When the sisters could not find the fabric clothes they wanted to show under the furs their women ready-to-wear line was born (in 1977), again to great success. In 1999 the sisters sold out to LVMH and Prada for an estimated US$850m.",http://www.fendi.com

Amidst a worldwide oil crisis, during which diesel was considered to be an alternative fuel, Renzo liked the idea of his brand to be known as an alternative jeans brand, in contrast to the prevalent casual wear giants that had come before. Renzo intended to reach the entire world since the brand’s very inception, making the word “diesel,” an international term pronounced equally all over the world, the perfect name for his endeavor.
Since its start, Diesel has used “For Successful Living” as a slogan for the brand’s DNA. Through a long and storied history of strong, ironic and playful campaigns, Diesel has become a leader in advertising as well as in fashion. Where the world zigged, Diesel zagged, and in the 35 years since its founding, the brand still embraces the same ethos. Diesel has over 5,000 points of sale worldwide with over 400 monobrand stores, 37 of those in the US. Between 1978 and 2012, the company has produced more than 2,000 different washes of denim.

Protagonists Aldo and Margherita Fulanetto set themselves the challenge of starting a company – one which was eventually to grow into a world-renowned leather goods brand. In 1955 Aldo opened the first Furla store on Via Ugo Bassi in the heart of Bologna, selling leather bags and accessories. In the 1970s, when the baton was passed on to his children Giovanna, Carlo and Paolo Furlanetto, the first collection of bags carrying the Furla logo was launched. The collections grew at the same pace as the company. With the 1980s just around the corner, Giovanna flanked her father making her own stylistic contributions, while Carlo and Paolo were mostly in charge of the brand’s strategy for growth. 

Furla invented a new concept of luxury which was close to every woman and immediately became an international 'must.” By the end of 2008, 296 single-brand Furla stores have been established, positioned on the most important international shopping streets, and more than a thousand sales outlets from shops to department stores.

Then filmmaker Isabel Coixet whispered a word, “Desigual”, and accompanied it with the motto “no es lo mismo” (“it’s not the same”).

Spanish graphic designer, illustrator and sculptor, Peret, sketched our first logo: the Humans (a woman and a man holding hands... naked). And architect Tonet Sunyer designed the first Desigual store in Ibiza’s port in 1986. Those years served as a meeting point for many people who were fascinated by this free, authentic, optimistic, unapologetic and Mediterranean universe which, from Barcelona, continues to inspire the world more than three decades later.

The company was founded in 1988 in Glasgow, UK. The brand is known for its contemporary men's shirting and leather goods. Having launched as a shirt specialist of some repute in Glasgow Ted Baker quickly became the place to buy some of the very best contemporary men's shirting around.

From the beginning Ted has had a very clear, unswerving, focus on quality, attention to detail and a quirky sense of humour, so much so in fact that the first stores used to provide a laundry service for every shirt purchased – something that gained the quickly growing brand the title of ‘No Ordinary Designer Label’. Everything produced under the Ted Baker name has his personality woven into its very heart.

• Ted Baker is one of the fastest-growing leading lifestyle brands in the UK.
• The collections have expanded rapidly since its beginnings as a menswear brand in Glasgow in 1987.
• Today Ted Baker offers a wide range of collections including: Menswear, Womenswear, Global, Endurance, Pashion, Langley, Accessories, Fragrance, Skinwear, Footwear, Eyewear and Watches.
• Ted Baker has a portfolio of stores in the UK and USA and is also present in leading department stores.
• After signing three new territorial license agreements in 2006 and initially opening stores in Hong Kong, Singapore and Dubai we've continued our expansion in 2007 with the opening of a further store in Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok, three in Kuala Lumpur and two each in Dubai and Jakarta. We also have locations in Taiwan and Bangkok.",https://www.tedbaker.com
