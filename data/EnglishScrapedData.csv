0039 Italy,['Womenswear'],"BRAND: 0039 Italy DESCRIPTION: When a German label manages to free its blouses from its conservative stereotype image, then it is somewhat surprising. When this brand has succeeded for many years to inspire with its collections, then this is no longer a surprise success, but rather a constant success story. This is the story of 0039 Italy.

A story, which began in the year 2000 during a trip to Italy. From a simple beach blouse designed out of necessity, it soon became more inspired. It even managed to have a 12 sq. m stand at the Paris trade fair with the first collection in 2001. Today 0039 Italy’s clothes adorn stores in over 50 countries worldwide. What makes 0039 Italy different to other labels? The answer is as easy as it is plausible. The brand remains true to itself and to its roots – blouses were, are and remain the centrepiece of every collection.

Instead of losing itself in a wide, exchangeable range, it prefers to play and coquet with colours, patterns and even forms. The result? Endearing details, unusual creative designs and all of this always of a surprising, sophisticated quality made in Europe. 0039 Italy’s customers appreciate the brand’s richness of the facets with blouses and other parts for every occasion, every shape and every age. Classical. Fashionable. Sober. Or multi-coloured and typically Mediterranean. Even the name is as untypically German as the parts. But why should everything always be fabric softened and fitted? The fact is that no woman can misdial with the stylish Italian area code in her luggage…

0711,['Bags'],"BRAND: 0711 DESCRIPTION: Brand 0711 was founded in 2012 by Nino Eliava and Ana Mokia. Girls have met in childhood during holidays in Mexico, and the idea of the joint project came many years later when they were studying and working in London. Nino and Ana got an education in sphere of business and management, now harmoniously sharing the responsibilities - Nino is behind the creative process, while business growth is up to Ani. The idea of 0711 creation (by the way, these are girls’ favorite digits) appeared in parallel with an online project MORE is LOVE.

Each 0711 hand-woven product is created manually by artisans in Georgia. The artisans are elderly women for whom knitting is a very native and favorite craftsmanship passed from ancestors. Innovative knitting technique in organic glass and plywood frames were adopted in 2015 for the most popular style ‘Copacabana’. Today among the brand’s top models are also ‘St. Barts’ and ‘St. Tropez’. Improvising with traditional weaving and shapes, 0711 introduced pearl beaded bags with various models from bucket to tote bags, mixing it with the brand’s multicolor plywood and plexiglass frames.

AW18 proclaimed a new era for the brand presenting ‘Bea’ - the  rst style in leather inspired by the key model ‘Copacabana’ as well. The production of leather styles is also based in Georgia, but from high-quality French calfskin. Today, the main face of the brand is the tote bag ‘Nino’ which was presented after the huge pearl styles success. ‘Nino’, decorated with pearl handles, is available now in all kinds of fabrics,
sizes and colors (and can be even customized). Also the audience’s favorite one is delicious ‘Shu’.

And we believe the right place to get a great pair of running shoes is your local specialist running store. That’s where you can find our products. We are a team of industry experts and we’ve built 361° as a brand and company that is close to the running community. We serve runners with specific running experiences – our shoes. Our European headquarters are located in the Amsterdam area and we are a diverse team of people. With various cultural backgrounds nationalities, we are all experts in our fields.

Gow spent over four years researching materials and learning and perfecting his own techniques for 3D design and craft.  He made a promise to himself that he would not settle for anything less than the ultimate material from which to create his designs.   Eventually he found it.  A unique, sustainable material, made from recycled paper that had been created for the manufacture of high-end interior furnishings.

It was perfect for Gow to finally create the products within his Dappe collection.  He was know able to offer true ’Sustainable luxury’.

Gow took the inspiration he found within his cultural heritage, his deep understanding of the principles of hairdressing and four years solely dedicated to design and development, to create his first original product, Dappe Comb.  

Following the release of his signature product, Dappe Collection has expanded to include unisex accessories to both desk and table ware.

This guiding philosophy is evident in the pieces we've developed since then: our shirts, jackets, basics and accessories all take cues in form and function from our jeans. Fabrics and trims are always chosen for their capacity to develop character with time. Our aim is that, with diligent wear, our customers are rewarded with something well aged, never “old.”

With that question in mind, Margje started researching and developing. Combining different styles, techniques and fabrics, slowly coming towards a way to fill the gap. And after many months – if not years – of improving on quality, comfort and style, by the end of 2018 7SQR officially launched their first collection which filled this gap. Wholesale:

8beaufort Hamburg,"['Footwear', 'Bags']","BRAND: 8beaufort Hamburg DESCRIPTION: 8beaufort.hamburg is more than an ordinary fashion brand.

Because we want to preserve and protect the harsh wind and the thundering waves that we carry in our name, we manufacture our products from natural materials and discarded sailcloths that were used on flat-bottomed ships and wooden boats in the Wadden Sea of ​​the North Sea and in the English Channel. Through this principle of recycling and upcycling, the reuse and further use of materials that have already been used, we not only actively reduce the garbage that pollutes our oceans. In contrast to many other manufacturers, we also use European leather and waxed cotton and rely on vegetable tanning agents. This reduces CO2 emissions and protects the environment from pollutants.

And in order to be as responsible as possible, we only work with reliable partners: our shoes are made by family businesses in Portugal. The bags are made in certified companies in the global south that work according to EU standards and guarantee ecological production and fair working conditions.

The result: sustainable products that stand for individual style and maximum well-being and will take the fashion industry by storm.

Someone who owns an adhoc garment is often a customer who was looking for something ad hoc for a particular situation and ended up with a product made ad hoc for him.

So not only sportswear, but also garments aimed at “universal travellers”, to whom AHIRAIN wants to offer a personal style, setting new goals to find a meeting point between fashion contents and new technologies.

An idea restated through aesthetic essentiality which springs from extreme research in the structuring of garments and is enriched thanks to the use of special fabrics - mainly exclusive ones- with surprising details.

Starting from its debut with the women's 2016 fall/winter collection AHIRAIN conquered the windows of the most prestigious international retailers with greater diffusion in Far-east Asian markets such as Japan and Korea, followed by European markets -with Italy in first position- Russia and the United States: a success achieved thanks to the commitment of its team of designers dedicated to the creation of collections able to exhalt the technological know-how of Pellemoda, the brand's manufacturing company.

Founded 40 years ago by Bruno Morelli- Azzurra and Giampaolo's father- Pellemoda is in fact the ideal example of the Italian savoir faire. The company, with a solid turnover of 66 million euros, currently employs 250 collaborators gathered in the Empoli headquarters which covers a surface of approximately 13.000 sq m, at the centre of an industrial hub which still preserves a heritage of sensitivity and experience handed down by generations.

Over the years and thanks to constant investments, Pellemoda has acquired cutting-edge equipment working side by side with craftsmen and tailors. With a historical archive of over 6.000 garments, Pellemoda is a full-cycle company and manufactures collections in fabric, leather, fur for the most prominent Italian and foreign luxury maisons. Having always been concerned with issues like environment protection and sustainability, the company - which starting from 2013 has experienced an intense and articulate path - has obtained important certifications such as SA8000: 2014 and ISO 14001: 2015.

To the present day, Pellemoda is strongly committed to involving the entire production chain in complying with the ZDHC protocol for the purpose of gradually eliminating harmful chemicals in the various related production processes. At Pitti Connect AHIRAIN presents its men's 2021-22 fall/winter collection which is confirming the interest on the part of the most qualified international clientelle.

We feel empowered when we are most vulnerable, exposed to the elements. And only when we really feel free are we happy. But whenever possible, we always return to the people with whom we feel most at home. Safe and secure in the warm arms of our family.
That family feeling is in Airforce's DNA. Because although the warmth of family can never be completely imitated, we can create some extra warmth by making winter jackets of the highest quality. Originated from the love for our family. Because we know better than anyone how important family is. And we all deserve that extra bit of warmth.

A.Kjærbede,"['Eyewear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: A.Kjærbede DESCRIPTION: A. Kjærbede was created in 2016 by me, Adam Geertsen, with a desire to combine good quality and well-thought-out design - at a price where most people can participate. The basis of the brand is a solid ideology that price and quality are not necessarily related. I myself have been in the fashion business for more than 20 years and have always missed the affordable luxury. I named the brand A. Kjærbede because Kjærbede means ""man decision"" in Bornholm, and it refers to the process that I went through when I started the project.

It has taken a lot of work, and many critical decisions, to reach the right manufacturer, the right materials and designs. For me, it was a man's decision that was needed to create a product that I myself was proud of and wanted to take responsibility for.

The name also refers to Bornholm and Denmark. The egg in Kjærbede emphasizes the brand's Nordic origins, which are also the basis for the design inspiration every season.

A. Kjærbede publishes one collection a year. The inspiration for our sunglasses is taken from the general fashion picture and the major trends of the time. This combined with a high degree of timelessness and classic expressions. The essential thing about A. Kjærbede is a great focus on the details, which also raises the quality because a decision has been made for each small function and shape of the individual sunglasses.

A. Kjærbede is a company created with passion and love, and it is still me who handles most of the processes, even though the team has expanded with agents and distributors all over the world.

I hope you can sense the energy put into your new sunglasses when you unpack them. Our main purpose is that you are more than satisfied with your purchase.

Alchemist,['Womenswear'],"BRAND: Alchemist DESCRIPTION: Alchemist is born from the desire to combine sustainability with luxury fashion. Founder Caroline Mewe believes fashion and ethical business practices are equally important. That’s why we want to create beautiful clothing that is ethically produced made from sustainable materials.

The Alchemist collections are built to be worn through different seasons. The focus of the collections isn’t on following trends, but on high-quality designs that fit well. Every collection, we re-introduce essential pieces in new colors and fabrics. These essentials have been fitted and tested so they can lay the groundwork for a superb wardrobe. Our Philosophy

We believe that no single thing or person is an isolated phenomenon. Chemistry only starts when different elements interact.

According to myth and legend, alchemists were able to transform everyday, ordinary objects into something extraordinary and fantastic. They sought the formula to create gold. To the alchemists, gold symbolized the perfection of all matter, both material and spiritual. Like those mysterious scientists, we want to combine different elements to create a special and striking synthesis, something that surpasses its individual components. We believe that every single person that helps to create our collection brings equal value. Only together can we create gold.

A nation revered for its sophistication, ‘sprezzatura’ – the art of studied carelessness, spans it’s tailoring and sportswear. It’s where art and function come together to create something more than the sum of its parts – where perfection is in the interaction between garment and situation; in fading dyes, end-of-event creasing and unscheduled weather. It’s knowing your style holds up to whatever life throws at it. Alessandro Zavetti

It’s in the jeans. Alessandro Zavetti updates classic pieces, each season refining the best contemporary trends, evolving with the industry but always rooted in the backbone of the modern casual wardrobe: denim. Alessandro Zavetti uses modern fabrics and Italian tailoring to take streetwear somewhere fresh and exciting. Our collection of t-shirts are the perfect layer during the winter months but are just as suited to an afternoon on a beach in Ibiza. By pairing our t-shirts with our signature denim collection you'll create a classic look that needs no introduction.

With casual, strong-selling Styles. In the new AW21 CHOOSE LIFE collection, Alife & Kickin is not only representing their top sellers, but also a brand new knit capsule, for the first time neoprene, flannel and cord qualities. The collection comes along with a strong, clean branding together with a new logo. Also the range of quilted jackets in the womenswear and menswear segment has been expanded. Alife & Kickin also step up in terms of sustainability in our viscose products with the official Lenzing
licensed Ecovero.

#WEAREALIFE
Alife & Kickin is a street and sportswear brand with a focus on style, functionality and most important sustainability. Sustainable and environmental friendly clothing starts with the choice of materials. Alife & Kickin has banned all animal products from the collection, uses 100% recycled polyester and nylon for outdoor jackets, organic cotton for jersey styles. We are currently expanding the blouse and trousers models made of lyocell. And that‘s not all! In order to manufacture
innovative, environmental friendly and, above all, sustainable products, the choice of production places and a responsible production has a central importance for Alife & Kickin. Due to long-term partnerships and related regular factory visits, we guarantee the best possible working conditions, fair wages, no child labor and no modern slavary. Alife & Kickin are currently producing 100% vegan. The aim is to expand further sustainable steps in future collections. „We can‘t make the world a better place, but at least a little more conscious.“

#WEAREVEGAN
Veganism is not just a way of life, it is also an attitude to life that encourages an increasing demand for animal-free products. To make it easier for animal-friendly and ethically motivated consumers to make a purchase decision, especially in the fashion industry, PETA created the „PETA - Approved Vegan“ postmark. Alife & Kickin is now also officially PETA Approved Vegan and thus sets an example for vegan fashion with animal friendly materials and design. In addition, we have developed our own Code of Conduct, which defines rules of conduct for socially responsible corporate management.

#WEAREFAMILY
Alife & Kickin was founded in 2008. Started as a two-person team, now the company employs more than 50 people in Ellefeld and Berlin. The urban feeling of the big city will be clearly recognized in our upcoming Alife & Kickin collections: new branding, wide oversize cuts and new developed fabrics complete our previous styles. We are just reinventing our old time favourite looks and happy about the fresh, creative breeze from Berlin. Our Design and production team works on new collections, innovations in production and social media content directly located on the White Lake in Berlin.

#SUSTAINABLEMATERIALS
The Alife & Kickin street jackets are made from RECYCLED POLYESTER and NYLON. 90% of the sweats consist of a cotton mix with RECYCLED PES. The use of recycled synthetic fibers reduces ours dependence on crude oil and natural gas as a source of raw materials as we use recycled PET bottles to produce raw materials. It reduces waste, thus extending the life of the landfills and reduces toxic emissions from incinerators. The Alife & Kickin blouses and pants are made of LYOCELL. The cellulose fiber Lyocell offers a good, ecological sensible alternative to other man-made fibers and also to cotton. The starting material for the manufacture are woods from certified, sustainable sources. It just becomes a fraction of the amount of water consumed for production used by other man-made fibers. Lyocell is organic degradable and compostable. ORGANIC COTTON is used for Alife & Kickin jersey models. Unlike conventional cotton, it is grown during cultivation from organic cotton to the use of synthetic pesticides and artificial fertilizers are dispensed with. That means we don‘t have any toxic components.

Alife & Kickin knows the textile industry with all its facets, the needs of the market and the individual requirements of the retailer. In cooperation with our distributors, we translate those in a sales-optimized and trend-oriented style and supply customers with over 1000 points of sale such as Galeria Karstadt, Kaufhof, Peek & Cloppenburg, Otto, Zalando and AboutYou.

Allan K,"['Bags', 'Footwear']","BRAND: Allan K DESCRIPTION: Know-how based on more than 50 years of experience. Woven leather is the specialty of the Belgian Alain Kadic. In 1963, his father developed special machines to produce the finest woven leather creations for chic brands worldwide. Since 2012, they have been designing and producing also for its own brand, Allan K. In Madras, India, their creations are transformed into the most beautiful leather bags with impressive know-how. The centuries old techniques for weaving and braiding are part of the cultural heritage of the Madras region. It can take up to 3 to 5 days to weave an Allan K creation. Because all their pieces are made by hand, small irregularities or differences in colour can occur. These make their products extraordinary and one of a kind. Direct lines without expensive marketing costs keep the price attractively low, despite the excellent quality. Wholesale

Allbirds,"['Womenswear', 'Bodywear', 'Footwear', 'Accessories', 'Menswear']","BRAND: Allbirds DESCRIPTION: A native of New Zealand, Tim Brown was always well versed in the magical qualities of merino wool. Inherently curious, he began asking himself why such a remarkable, sustainable resource was virtually absent in the footwear industry. And with that spirit of wonder, the Allbirds journey began. After years of researching and tinkering, Tim teamed up with Joey Zwillinger, an engineer and renewables expert. Together, they crafted a revolutionary wool fabric made specifically for footwear. The outcome? An entirely new category of shoes inspired by natural materials, and an ongoing mantra to create better things in a better way.

ALPACA LOCA,['Accessories'],"BRAND: ALPACA LOCA DESCRIPTION: Alpaca Loca is a young and innovative label, based in Amsterdam. 
The brand offers fair products. Designed in Amsterdam, handmade in the Andes Mountains. The quality products are made of alpaca wool. Wool-weaving communities in the mountains of Ecuador and Peru make the products with a smile on their face. Sustainability and the Fair Trade concept are highly valued by Alpaca Loca. Also the brand wants to show that sustainability does not have to be expensive. The brand specializes in luxurious soft scarves and plaids/ throws, with fashion- and home accessories as an addition in the collection. Alpaca wool is naturally very soft and has many advantages to sheep wool or cashmere:

It’s a natural product with a softer and stronger structure than cashmere
The wool does not itch and it is dirt- and water resistant.
The empty fiber isolates better against cold.
Alpaca wool is hypoallergenic because it contains no lanoline like sheep wool.

The wool used for Alpaca Loca products comes from alpaca’s in Peru. The brand highly values quality, tradition, integrity and social responsibility. Each sale contributes to improving lives of the wool- weavers and alpaca farmers in the Andes Mountains. They receive a fair income, and the welfare of the animals is respected.

Even though there had been a shift toward mindfulness, many brands were claiming “sustainability” just to cash in on the “green trend.” The friends fantasized about quitting fashion altogether. But what if, they asked each other, they could make a brand that strived to do good, to salve some of the things that were broken, not just in the industry, but in their global communities? It was just a silly dream, full of good intentions. But a few days later, when one of the friends told his wife, an artist and designer, about their conversation, she started making sketches. She took a word from the conversation that stuck out to her—amendments—and wrote down another one of her own invention: AMENDI.

With an experienced business woman at our helm, we set out to develop T-shirts that resonated with young to mature women with dynamic lives. We were intimately familiar with the customers we served, because we created the pieces we couldn't find for ourselves in stores.

What sets our work apart from the typical pieces you see in other stores is the care and detail we put into our T-shirts. We consider all aspects of our designs, from the material and shape of our T-shirts to the graphics and embellishments we choose to include. That's also why we prioritize sustainable materials and humane labor. Countless hours of work goes into each and every one of our T-shirts, and we wouldn't want to have it any other way. At Amour&Luxe, we take pride in our work. It isn't just about selling clothes to us. It's about the fashion, and the fulfillment we feel when we help a client build their dream wardrobe.

We want to give you durable, versatile, and beautiful T-shirts that will form the foundation of your wardrobe. Clothes that naturally fit into your everyday outfits, not pieces you need to struggle to work around.

When our clients feel confident enough to build a flirty outfit with our T-shirts, or even just comfortable enough to have fun with it, we know that we have achieved our goal. Fashion that will suit you for every occasion.

It is now time to set foot on our own soil again and we are launching our new collection in Europe. We believe that magic is created when different cultures are intertwined. That is why Amsterdam Heritage does not have a specific distinctive “Dutch” or “American” appearance, but it is an amalgamation of both American and European fashion cultures.

The name Amsterdam Heritage refers, among other things, to the heritage of the leather industry in the Netherlands, which dates back to the 17th century and which is still a lively and creative sector to this day. Amsterdam Heritage therefore has the majority of its range of belts produced in its own country. We use almost exclusively high-quality Italian leather that is processed with Dutch craftsmanship into elegant leather accessories.

These shorts have been created with a two in one system. Our leisure shorts offer exactly the same comfort as an everyday short, but they are also suitable for swimming. Our new, recycled PET fabric is as light as a feather, durable and dries in minutes. The comfortable inner fabric is soft and makes our «Leisure Shorts» unbeatably comfortable and the zipper on the left pocket make the short more functional.

ANGULUS,['Footwear'],"BRAND: ANGULUS DESCRIPTION: ANGULUS was founded in 1904 by Willy Madsen’s father, who owned a cobbler’s shop on Nørrebrogade in Copenhagen, Denmark. Willy disagreed with the pointed shoes that many children wore at that time. He thought they were both unhealthy for growing feet and hindered natural movement. Willy gave up his job as a teacher to become a shoemaker, and in 1928, he astounded the Danish footwear industry with his new foot-formed shoes, developed in collaboration with doctors and physiotherapists.

The interest in Willy’s shoes grew and so did the great reputation. Before long, ANGULUS was the talk of the town, helped on by the fact that Willy had married Else Højgaard, one of the most popular ballerinas at The Royal Danish Ballet of the time. The couple even performed publicly, with Else wearing ANGULUS women’s shoes, which really paved the way for the brand, and soon ANGULUS was the largest shoe factory in Denmark.

Eventually, in 1949, Willy employed a leather buyer by the name of Roland Dawe. In the years that followed, he travelled all over Europe in search of quality leather. Roland had a keen eye for quality and also for the handsome foreign shoes he saw. In particular the Italian franchises were an inspiration in the development of the ANGULUS collections.

Today, ANGULUS shoes are designed in Copenhagen, Denmark by our talented designers.  Since March 2020, all ANGULUS shoes are handcrafted on our own factory in northern Portugal. Read more about the factory in Portugal here.

Every season, they send high quality shoes out into the world and onto the shelves of the best shops. Here, the quality-conscious customer can venture out into the world in ANGULUS shoes, that are not only beautiful to look at but also offer unparalleled comfort whether walking or standing still.

This year it has been over 115 years since the founding of the company, and today ANGULUS is a proud family owned company, passed down from generation to generation. Today father and son, Christian and Sebastian Dawe, are working side by side developing the ANGULUS brand.

ANGULUS is a visionary brand with two Flagship stores in the heart of Copenhagen. Read more about the shops here. In the shops you will find an exclusive selection for women, men and children, with all ANGULUS 'best and award winning shoes. At angulus.com you will find a wider selection. It's not always the same selection online as on the shelves of our store, so both are worth a visit.

New collections await. The story of ANGULUS continues.

But after searching on websites, she notices that there are only nice bras in common cup sizes, up to size D. The bras that were available in her size are plain, boring and oldfashioned. Years of frustration and insecurity about her larger cup size have led up to this moment. She decides to jump on this opportunity to serve other women, of all shapes and sizes. The idea of Annadiva is born. Today, Annadiva is one of the larger online webshops in lingerie, swimwear, nightwear, shapewear and sportswear in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. Besides the webshop, Annadiva has three physical stores; in Den Bosch, Nijmegen and Amsterdam.
 
In addition to several retail brands, Annadiva also has its own swimwear line since 2021 and a lingerie and nightwear line followed soon.

But finding something that matches the latest trends often becomes more difficult. ""We are there precisely for ladies with a so-called 'difficult' size.

Lyon is the capital of weaving and printing on silk since the Renaissance. Although our scarves are mixed, our main aim was to make men wear silk scarves again, with that elegance and touch of chic so characteristic of the early 20th century dandyism. That time when explorers, aviation pioneers, the first car racers and motorcyclists accomplished their exploits always with this silk scarf, so elegant, so precious and so useful. 

Since then, other accessories for men's coquetry have been added to our collection, always with the priority of promoting our national craft and industrial heritage.

ARKK Copenhagen,['Footwear'],"BRAND: ARKK Copenhagen DESCRIPTION: ARKK Copenhagen was born on a summer night in 2014, when two lifelong friends Thomas Refdahl and Kasper Høj Rasmussen (fuelled by a few gin and tonics), decided to go all in on a big idea—to create a sneaker that would be comfortable, functional and designed in a way that embodied the Scandinavian simplistic tradition for design. 18 months (and a lot of sleepless nights) later, the first ARKK sneaker—the Raven—debuted and then promptly sold out.

Since then, we’ve never looked back. Like fashion, art, and architecture, sneaker design is never finished.

Which is why we’re passionate about the process of design, innovation, and the comfort of our products. With every new sneaker design and with every new collection, we’re learning, growing, and experimenting. In the spirit of the great Scandinavian designers who came before us, we’re inspired each and every day by the question, ‘what if?’ You could say we’re obsessed. You wouldn’t be wrong.

While the Copenhagen-based brand continues to focus, first and foremost, on sneaker design and innovation, this new apparel line allows customers to experience ARKK quality, aesthetics, and detailing from head to toe. Speaking of details, each item of apparel features a small embroidered logo of ARKK’s original sneaker—the Raven—as a nod to the brand’s origins and core DNA.

""Apparel is something that we have wanted to create for years, ever since the beginning actually,” says ARKK co-founder and creative director Kasper Høj Rasmussen, “but for us, the focus for the past four years has been on sneakers.” With regards to the timing of this new product launch, ARKK CEO and co-founder Thomas Refdahl explains, “our customers and retailers have been asking about apparel for years, but we feel that, with the sneakers we’re releasing and the growth we’re experiencing, now is finally the right time.”

The founders were destined to step into the world of leather and shearling. As of the early fifties in the 20th century, their father worked as a tradesman for leather skins and shearlings in Armenia. Ever since, he passed on the art of leather processing to his sons. Fueled with the insight earned from success in the first phase of manufacturing leather garments, the brothers Aykaz managed to establish the A R M A group brand internationally. Supported by its carefully selected retailers, the brand became known for its favorable quality / performance-price ratio. 

As of today, a third generation is successfully modernizing the wholesale strategy into a contemporary designer brand. Placing importance on creating investment pieces without compromising on quality or design.

A. Roege Hove,['Womenswear'],"BRAND: A. Roege Hove DESCRIPTION: A. ROEGE HOVE  is a conceptual knitwear brand that challenges traditions with a modern and artistic approach to original craftsmanship and an aim for silhouettes to be both effortless and extravagant.

The unique designs are created each season by founder Amalie Røge Hove. With a master’s in textile design from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, and years of experience as a knitwear designer for Danish brands such as Cecilie Bahnsen and Mark Tan, she created the brand in 2019 as a way of bringing her own visions of knitwear to life. And it has been evolving and developing ever since. Defined by an experimenting and intuitive way of working with traditional knitwear techniques, the brand challenges our perception of shape and pushes our expectations of the materials and their behavior. 

Containing only accessories, the very first collection was a study in small-scale sculpturalism. Later these studies were expanded into a larger scale with the first collection of ready-to-wear, bringing the concepts from bag to body.

CHILD'S PLAY
Chloé de Bailliencourt spent her summer holidays in the Basque coast, and this is why she has a very rooted link to nature, the ocean and the mountains. Still very young, Chloe has designed and crafted clothes, something that had already been done for generations in her family. After her life in Paris and London where she studied, she was in charge of the artistic direction of “Contre Vents et Marées”, and few years later, in 2005, she decided to settle in Ciboure. Arsène starts to grow FROM CIBOURE TO TOKYO 
It was in an old mechanical workshop still cluttered with machines that Chloé launched the Arsène et les pipelettes adventure with just few customers. Little by little, this small company started to grow, and own-name boutiques have been opened in France and in Europe since its foundation. Nowadays, the brand has 150 points of sale all over the world, in Europe, Asia and in the United States. She started with a baby and children collection before launching the women’s collection.

Arthur,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Kidswear', 'Bodywear']","BRAND: Arthur DESCRIPTION: ARTHUR WAS BORN

It was in 1983 that the Arthur adventure began! The two founders, freshly graduated from ESSEC, had the brilliant idea of revolutionising the world of underwear in France. How ? By imposing boxer shorts on a market where briefs reigned supreme. An immediate success ! Arthur doubled or even tripled his sales every year.  This growth continued at a crescendo until the end of the 1980s, like a tidal wave ! FROM BOXER SHOTS TO HOMEWEAR

Encouraged by their success, the two designers decided to revive the world of pyjamas by bringing their know-how and their touch of fantasy ! Arthur became a must-have brand on the
market of underwear and homewear for the whole family. Year after year, we launched different ranges: innerwear for men and children (in 1986), socks (in 1987), the women's line (in 1990), all of which Arthur climbed little by little, until reaching the crucial stage...

THE OPENING OF THE FIRST ARTHUR FAMILY CONCEPT STORE

And yes, in 1992, we opened our first boutique, in Paris, Avenue Victor Hugo. A symbolic opening for a French brand, whose values have managed to impose themselves and become those of an entire community, almost like a common vision of fashion. It is this innovative look at the market that has allowed the brand to establish itself brilliantly !


ARTHUR GOES DIGITAL

Very early on, we understood that the internet was a major stepping stone for the development of the brand, and we launched our website in 1998, one of the first ! A way of inscribing the brand in its era, through the beginnings of a new era that will make it even more current : the digital era. Once again Arthur truly stands out as an almost visionary brand, whose vision is founded in the world of underwear and home wear.


THE REVIVAL OF AN ICONIC BRAND

In the 2010s, Arthur takes a new turn, and operates an evolution in its
brand spirit. A rather innovative architectural concept was developed in 2015 on the boutiques, while four new shops appeared in Bourg-en-Bresse, Aix-les-Bains, Montpellier and Bayonne.
In 2018, it is Monaco's turn to welcome us, giving a new breath of fresh air to this pioneer, yet so modern brand. And it's not about to stop !

The first collection was launched in September 2021 using minimal geometry as its most important style element.

She combines subtle geometries with confident fits to create a timeless, elegant and unique look.

The same goes for the fabrics: all thoughtfully chosen or repurposed, providing you with the best quality. The sophisticated craftsmanship is clearly visible.

Atelier Minimalist firmly believes in the 'slow design approach'. Therefore, the label focuses on timeless collections that blend into each other. New variations of existing pieces are re-invented in different colours, fabrics or proportions and added to the collection.

We hope to inspire people to support local & sustainable production and invest in timeless fashion.

ATP Atelier,"['Footwear', 'Bags', 'Accessories']","BRAND: ATP Atelier DESCRIPTION: ATP Atelier was born out of the desire to create shoes and leather goods that couple contemporary Scandinavian design and authentic Italian craftsmanship. The mission is to challenge the concept of luxury - to make it smart, not redundant. With a sustainable mindset ATP Atelier sets out to create, not just because, but to make a real difference in women’s lives. Founders Jonas Clason and Maj-La Pizzelli first met in the late 80’s at legendary Swedish fashion brand and retail stores Gul & Blå. Each recognizing in the other a passion for style rather than fashion. They went their separate ways, spending the next two decades learning the business and honing their talents before finally bumping into each other at exactly the right time, in exactly the right place.

The year was 2011 and the place was Otranto, a small Italian town on a cliff in the south in Puglia. You know the kink, with cafés, ice cream bars and restaurants. It’s genuine and vibrant, we like that.

So, what does Otranto have to do with shoes? Everything. This is where Maj-La and Jonas spent a month’s vacation with family and friends. Walking through town they found a small studio making sandals. Everyone got a pair and wore little else for the rest of the summer. And that’s what sparked the idea of ATP Atelier and a product that combined contemporary Scandinavian design with authentic Italian craftsmanship.

Attic and Barn began its journey as a brand that exclusively produced printed silk garments. In the following years it expanded its product line, offering in a short period of time a complete total look of footwear, bags and accessories.

Attic and Barn has evolved from season to season thanks to the use of refined processing techniques and the constant search for new styles and trends, with current distribution within Europe and many important international showcase windows.

Its strategic sales and commercial intuitions, combined with personal taste and style and company management experience, help shape the Attic and Barn brand today into one that meets the needs of a constantly evolving market.

Imagine a Paris so perfect that you would feel free to leave it, and come back loving it all the more. A poetic escapade between Haussmann-style façades and tropical exuberance, the narrow streets of Montmartre and the Lower East Side, the fountains on the Place de l’Etoile and the Amalfi coast, Central Park and the ponds in the Tuileries gardens: that is the spirit of Aurélie Bidermann. Created in 2004, it reflects the DNA of its eponymous founder: a never-ending journey between zinc rooftops, emerald-green forests of South America, a sensual island, the vibrant colours of unknown flowers, and the cobalt blue of an infinite ocean.

Paris and all these other places are the firm’s creative crucible, boosted by a very Parisian sense of fashion and a coquettishness that stems not only from beauty but also from natural grace. This spirit infuses the multi-coloured cottons in the Copacabana and Do Brasil collections, cult jewels reminiscent of holiday souvenirs, coloured stone cabochons in the Miki rings, the sensual curves of the Diana line, whose sorbet hues cultivate eternal summer.

“AVASAN is individualism, minimalism, utter elegance” Amy Valentine, The Founder 

AVASAN began its journey in Summer 2017 with the holistic mission of creating a circular fashion brand through clothes designed with deadstock luxury fabrics, seasoned with exclusive embroidery, artistic paintings or accessories applied by hand.

 After a long trip across Japan, Amy Valentine, founder and creative director in AVASAN, became a loyal lover of Kimonos, and decided to create a sustainable fashion brand that represents the meeting of cultures and the relative inclusiveness among them, as an irreversible choice to this very day.

 AVASAN was born as a fusion of men’s Japanese tailoring techniques and feminine lines with sustainability at its brand core. With referents from Art, Theather and a modern, genderless twist, Kimono Collections by AVASAN are becoming a hit among international press and fashion buyers alike.

The lush, individual shapes with detailed embellishments through embroidery and structures, as well as the unconventional handling of textures and the reversible designs, create fashion with couture aspects, from high-quality materials, which is handmade and limited.

We think it’s important for all the women out there to feel like a Goddess and be treated like one… But especially treats herself like one. The designs are created for every female body.

Besides that we want to make beautiful designs for all women, AYA LABEL wants to be part of the environmental changes..

People all over the world are over using plastic which causes pollution of our environment. It comes from rubbish, fishing nets that are discarded, washing synthetic clothing and even by just brushing our own teeth. All these daily actions result that in the near future there will be more plastic than fish in our oceans.
Doesn’t sound good right?
Our designs are made of 78% recycled old fishing nets which create all of our swimwear you love! We are always looking for new recycled and sustainable fabrics to work with. But unfortunately working with these recycled materials isn’t enough… That’s why we donate a percentage of our profit towards environmental organizations that protect the oceans.
With our story and material usage we want to contribute to the awareness of the plastic problem all over the world.

Be a Goddess, Save the ocean!

Baileys,['Menswear'],"BRAND: Baileys DESCRIPTION: The history of Baileys:
Undoubtedly Baileys is a major player in the fashion industry when it comes to menswear. The history of the brand goes back to the last century. It all started in 1955, when Mr. Verweij opened a small gentlemen’s shop in the center of Rotterdam. He was one of the first fashion stores in the Netherlands to import high-quality and exclusive clothing from Italy. Because his eye for detail and strong focus on quality, result-oriented hard work quickly becomes a great success. In no time he exchanged his small menswear store for a department in the World Fashion Center in Amsterdam. The fashion industry was completely impressed by the great collections that he brought back to the market every season. After many successful years, Mr Verweij was born to take a different approach. He started his own production department with his team. From design to production and sales, everything he did in-house. This was definitely the start of a brilliant career that resulted in the Verweij Fashion group, which now includes four renowned brands.

In 1990 his two sons Karel and Robert Verweij took over the business under the watchful eye of their father. Today the Verweij Fashion Group is continued with great passion and success.

Our high quality collections:
Baileys originated worldwide and the demand for the high-quality collections continues to increase today. The Baileys brand distinguishes itself from competitors by selectively selecting fabrics and yarns and producing the garments in the best factories in Europe and around the world.

Over the years, the Balibaris ideal closet built and filled itself with nice blend of balanced modernity, iconics and noticeable yet subtle details and renewed classics inspired by the cinema. A style which doesn’t end up out of date, combined with an honest approach built together with our suppliers to guarantee the quality of fabrics, the sharpness of shapes, the relevance of prices and the durability of our clothes: this defines best Balibaris’ collections. When I first started working, I realised that these clothes that I wanted to wear in and outside the office, didn’t exist. Why not imagine them myself?

It all started with a collection of ties which found an enthusiastic response among those who, like me, wanted to get back to timeless looks and cherish good taste and common sense in fashion.

Over the years, the ideal closet built and filled itself with the will to find the right balance, be it in the shapes, fabrics or the origins of the items. Why should one choose between quality, transparency and price? On the contrary, Balibaris is meant to make style and good taste easygoing and affordable, as well as life easier. Indeed, in a way, the perfect shirt can help in having a better day.

And more than clothes, I want to rally the Balibaris community around a certain kind of lifestyle, made of enthusiasm, openness and curiosity.

Headquartered in Amsterdam, BARTS is sold across Europe with more than 3.000 selling points. Besides Winter accessories, the brand recently expanded to offer a complete Summer assortment with swim-and beachwear for women, men and kids. A whole new and exciting chapter. 

OVER 2500 UNIQUE DESIGNS
BARTS is specialized in high quality fashion accessories for men, women and kids. We’re based in Amsterdam and design accessories to keep you warm in the winter and cool in the summer because we believe that life starts outside. From trendy beanies and hand-knitted scarves to cool backpacks – every piece is unique. Even after twenty-five years, our designers keep surprising us almost every day with funky ideas, original combinations and unconventional thinking to transform functional accessories into something special. When that happens, we know we’re on the right track.

HOW IT ALL STARTED
The story of BARTS started in the summer of 1986 when Bart Koene sold his hand-sewn swim shorts along the beaches of St. Tropez. It proved to be a big hit. One of the girls helping him out wrapped a piece of fabric around her head to protect herself from the sun and soon people asked if they could buy this cool bandana. From that moment Bart started to focus on headwear. And only a few years later the brand BARTS was born. BARTS resellers with a B2B account can go to our B2B portal straight away. You will also find product and model images which can be downloaded to promote BARTS products in your store, or on your own website.

The desire was - and still is - to give more women the opportunity to emphasize their personality. We believe that good style equals personal style, which compliments your personality.

We are creative by nature and have worked with design and graphic lines all our lives. An posting in China early on led to a lifelong fascination with the amazing process of silk; from small, insignificant silkworms to the finest silk by the meter.

We follow the trends of the time and are inspired by encounters with different cultures on our travels around the world. We always work with a wide range of our own, unique prints, good materials and strong color combinations in our collections. At BELLA BALLOU, we strive to improve every day. This is especially true of sustainability. We want to be open and honest about our initiatives, and as a fashion brand, this is also our moral obligation. We have a holistic approach to sustainability and relate to it throughout the design process. From the materials we use in our collections, to how our suppliers operate and what environmental impact our production has. And not least: the conditions for the people we work with.

Our prints are unique, timeless and never go out of fashion. About half of our collection is digitally printed, which is a more sustainable production method compared to traditional screen printing, as only 10 percent ink is used in this process.

Jones teamed up with Ian Falconer, CEO at Fishy Filaments, in 2019. Fishy Filaments are the manufacturers of the Marine Nylon® material used for the production of Benthos Buttons. Fishy Filaments purchase old nets from fishermen, giving them an incentive to not disregard them at sea. Ghost fishing nets make up for 10% of the ocean pollution problem. Fishy Filaments’ Marine Nylon® has a 97% less environmental impact in comparison to virgin nylon.  As the entire manufacturing process for Benthos Buttons is all held in the same County, transportation emissions are kept to a minimum.

BENZAK is a European denim and lifestyle brand from Amsterdam. Founded in 2013 ago, BENZAK set out with a strong focus on creating high-quality made-to-last garments. We prioritise craftsmanship and timeless design to transcend trends and seasons. With simplicity, comfortability and utilitarian design at the forefront of the brand, we entered the world of artisanal denim and quality goods. The brand was inspired by founder Lennaert's formative years in garment development and production. Fundamentally, we're denim developers and style enthusiasts; we’re trying to do something that resonates with our own interests, and that is true to our roots. From the cut to the fabric, stitch count to the trimmings and contemporary styling; everything about BENZAK comes down to the finer and more meaningful details.

Our deep understanding of tradition merges with quality design and meticulous details. Our construction and style methodologies derive from our foundational Japanese influences. We’re big believers in creating approachable apparel that follows lifestyle instead of fashion. Denim or non-denim, our creative processes are consistently in-line with our beliefs.

As a forward-thinking brand in an ever-changing environment, we naturally illustrate where we are through what we produce; whether this is our content, a collection, exclusive pieces, collaborations or events. Our intuitive behaviour can be seen from the inside out. We've evolved into a fully-fledged lifestyle brand, we are designing modern apparel that really pays homage to traditional workwear.

Betmar,['Accessories'],"BRAND: Betmar DESCRIPTION: Betmar's history goes back to the depths of the Great Depression in America. The year was 1933 - The hat business was flourishing in spite of the difficult economic times. 

Wearing a hat was part of every day dressing for men and women. Betmar, a new brand focused on women's millinery, was in need of a strong factory. A partnership was formed with a skilled old-line cap maker with roots dating back to 1911 in New York. From this Betmar was born. The name chosen was taken from Betty Marks, the first designer for the hat company. Within six months Betmar blossomed at key department stores around the country. Betty Marks continued making great designs into the 1950s, and her protégé, Miss Arleen, carried the name and reputation forward for many years. Betmar is sold today in more than 15 countries and is a leader in women's headwear fashion.

I am sweating my vagina off trying to move mountains and I could really use your help. I’m strong as a mother but this is going to take a group effort.
All over the globe dream teams are pairing up to influence the slow-fashion movement - yes it's a real thing - and it's time conscious active women everywhere knew about it. Slow-fashion is a set of core values meant to inspire designers and brands who wish to take part, to find creative ways to be as eco-friendly, ethical and green as possible.
Though activewear is one of the largest and fastest growing industries, my recent study revealed almost no brands are advocating for sustainable and social initiatives in their own production process. Many brands have social impact give-back programs, with partial proceeds going to various non-profit organizations, but little is being done to reduce their own carbon footprint and ensure their goods are being manufactured ethically.
The values of slow-fashion have yet to permiate the activewear industry, and I would LOVE your help in changing that. Will you help me empower conscious women everywhere with slow-fashion activewear, so we can all feel good about giving back while moving forward with our fitness goals? Wholesale

It was great therapy for me, a way for me to get out of daily distress.

I started using this one image as a signature. One day my friend Juhani Putkonen (later co- founder) came to visit me in Buffalo, he was mesmerized by my signature image that appeared in every painting I had made.

We decided that we should do something more with it. After we tossed ideas around for a while, we decided to start a clothing line called Billebeino and use my signature as the logo

Billi Bi,['Footwear'],"BRAND: Billi Bi DESCRIPTION: The beginning of an adventure
In 1936 Søren and Evelyn Friis started a production of shoes for children in an old stable on Vibevej in the northwest area of Copenhagen. A few years after starting the company they decided to expand by also making women’s shoes, an investment that paid off and shortly became the primary business for Fransi A/S, today with Billi Bi as their main brand. Quality and craftsmanship has always been core values for the Friis Family. But back in the 1930's when Søren and Evelyn were starting up, there was a shortage of classic leather materials. This, however, did not hold back the hard-working couple, it only drove them to be more creative using different kinds of fish-skin for the shoe production. Søren and Evelyn made everything from flounder and eel to lumpfish and catfish into fashionable designer shoes. The shoes were made on roomy lasts with rounded toes, in douche colours, giving the shoes an elegant and exclusive Italian look. Today the old designs can be seen in exhibitions at Brede Museum.

Second generation
Carl Friis, son of Søren and Evelyn, was destined to dedicate his life to making shoes. As a child he helped out in the factory and in 1956 when he turned 16 he started his training as a shoemaker in the factory. With diligence and curiosity he learned the art of shoemaking from scratch, on the side he attended evening classes in Economics and Italian. When Carl had learned all he could about shoemaking in his parents’ factory he went to Italy to study the art of shoe design and construction at the prestigious school ARS SUTORIA. Here he excelled by graduating “Modellista – Tagliatore” with the highest grade given that year (9 out of 10). He extended his stay in Italy to work for 6 months in an Italian shoe factory.

Carls drawing skills were excellent and during his stay in Italy he drew numerous designs and sent them home to Denmark. His Italian endeavours were an invaluable experience, which have continued to inspire him to this day. Carl was praised in the Italian Fashion Press and in the 6o's considered a member of the Danish fashion elite. In charge today are Carl and Carsten Friis – son and grandson of the founders.

BITTE KAI RAND,"['Womenswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: BITTE KAI RAND DESCRIPTION: OUR STORY

BITTE KAI RAND was founded in 1981 by the eponymous designer who, fresh out of the Royal Danish Design Academy, acquired the most prolific Danish knitting workshop of the time, ""Steen's hjemmestrikkerier"", and quickly became Copenhagen’s equivalent to Sonia Rykiel in Paris.

All items were made to order and the designer got a firm grasp on what customers require from their clothes and how to fit clothes to real bodies rather than standard shapes.

“I didn’t have a strategy or a goal. I never made a business plan. I just loved going to work every day,” remembers BITTE KAI RAND.

Fortunately, her husband, Michael Rand, had an eye for Bitte's potential as well as her talent. In 1983 he joined the company and together they created the long-lasting success that has brought the special Bitte design sensibility to style-savvy women all over the world - long before ""Scandi Cool"" was even a fashion term. A few years in, the creative director learned how to scale her supply to demand, and soon became a household name in the most prestigious fashion outlets in Denmark as well as in department stores and design boutiques in Stockholm, Oslo, London, New York, and Antwerp.

Today the BITTE KAI RAND team can look back on four unpredictable decades. From the 80s sculptural shoulders and drop-crotch pants, the 90s designer denim and logo tees, into the 00s play with proportions to the 10s exploration of what is at the core of the brand’s aesthetics. The masculine versus the feminine, the architectural lines versus the organic forms, the artistic prints versus the monochrome surfaces.

The brand has been ahead of the game, featuring real people in their advertising since the ’90s including a mother breastfeeding her child, an older lady with a gold tooth and a gorgeous street cast of shiny, happy people from all over the world.

More than ever the heritage of the brand is preserved because passion, playfulness and a refusal to follow conventional commercial restraints or short-lived trends are still at the heart of each collection. The clothes are created for real people, colourful parties, work, pleasure and play. They are created for all the women who would rather stand out than fit in.

Black and Gold is a fashion brand established in Belgium. We provide clothing & accessories online on a global scale. We’re also working with on – and offline distributors across Europe and the US. Created in 2015 by Maxim Sion and Nicolas Maes, Black and Gold has grown consistently. The founders found inspiration in Latin America while traveling. They were moved by the Mexican tradition of ‘Día de los Muertos’: a ritual that honors the deceased, and uses skulls as a representation of love and joy. The skull became a key element in our brand image – embodying exuberance, passion and energy.

Latin America is the muse behind Black and Gold. Our stylish clothing and accessories capture the passion of a world that you feel running through your veins.

Blue de Genes,['Menswear'],"BRAND: Blue de Genes DESCRIPTION: Founded on the values of craftsmanship, quality materials and attention to details, we go to work every day with a vision to create products that never go out of style, can be used for a long time and will age beautifully upon wear. To do our designs justice, we source quality materials from around the world, add a sense of craftsmanship and use traditional techniques of making clothes. We do so to honor the story behind blue jeans.

Inspiration
Focusing on quality materials and attention to details, we offer a full clothing line, featuring strong identity jeans,  authentic knitwear, tailored waistcoats and jackets, inspired by clothing as it looked in the 1600s in Genoa. Claiming that indigo is ”flowing in our veins”, we promise to continue the legacy of Genoa. We put a lot of effort into every detail of our jeans, whether that being the fabric quality, the fit and feeling, the buttons or the wash of the jeans. Jeans are the very soul of Blue de Gênes and we never compromise. The finest fabrics are sourced from the best suppliers like Kuroki in Japan and Berto in Italy. Our buttons and rivets are customized and branded, giving the jeans the final touch.

Craftsmanship
All of our jeans are with chain stitch at the hem and waistband. This is the original way and one of the ways you recognize a premium denim product. We use leather reinforcements as unique details, angle our coin pockets slightly and double line the back pockets for longer durability - just like they did about 400 years ago when clothing was made to last. We are adamant when it comes to quality. This gives our jeans character. It is truly in the details. Production
 
To honor the history of jeans, we produce our jeans at a small family-owned factory in northern Italy. It took a while to find a factory with the same love for the product - putting in the same amount of effort as we do. But we succeeded - and it shows when you hold the product.
 
We love beautiful, washed jeans and there is no place in the world where they wash jeans as beautiful as in Italy. You genuinely feel the love, effort and craftsmanship that have been put into making every pair of Blue de Gênes.
 
Our suppliers are based around the world and 95 percent of our production is based in Europe at small family-owned companies in areas where they have specialized in their category. Our shirts are therefore made in Portugal, some of our pants are made in Turkey and some of our belts are made in Austria. Common to all of our suppliers are the long-term relations we have with them.

Buttons made of natural materials
 
There is something almost magical about the Corozo nut. Corozo nuts are the seeds of the Tagua palms, which grow all over South America, from northern Peru through Ecuador, Colombia to Panama. The seeds have been used for making buttons since long before plastic was invented, making this an old and special craft. Also known as vegetable ivory, the scratch and water resistant Corozo nut is a sustainable alternative with a natural grain that makes each button unique.
 
We honor this old craftsmanship by always using buttons made of Corozo nut in our shirt production to complement our designs.

For 10 years Blue Industry has distinguished itself with its own signature, sophisticated designs and a perfect fit.
At a time when sportswear dominates the fashion landscape, Blue Industry combines tailoring with the sportswear attitude. Jackets and shirts are at the heart of the Blue Industry world and we’re very proud of that. Beyond the perfect tailoring, our passions is expressed through the collection’s prints. The new spring/summer '20 graphics have been created using graphic designs from our large archive, taken by 12 years of designing.
When color is used it’s usually to pick out bright yellow and orange, which is the key detail for the season and defines the spring summer collection.
The print is Blue Industry’s take on a classic Hawaiian shirt design, which we have fashioned from a vibrant mixture of hand-drawn florals.
The floral print is used on either a yellow, red or blue base to give a new twist on summer shirts, while colors from the print have been used as solo graphics on knitwear
In short: a color palette that’s balanced and easy to combine.

In a disused industrial wasteland at Stuttgart's north train station, a brand idea emerged that we still stand for today: unmistakable and long-lasting fashion for women who have come to terms with themselves, far removed from the usual fashion trends.
Over the years we have grown steadily, both economically and personally. Our head office is now in Berlin, where Karin Ziegler found her creative and familiar home.

We look forward more and more every year, because the interest in our colorful creations now extends far beyond the borders of Germany. In addition to our own around 15 flagship stores and around 60 employees as well as around 300 trading partners, we are also steadily establishing ourselves within Europe.
This makes the anchor that stands for our adherence to the ground all the more important to us. With a Swabian soul and a Berlin feeling of home, we want to be market-oriented and always true to our philosophy, to make the world our home.
Full of zest for action, we set off with our loyal customers and blood sisters from the very beginning into new worlds of fabrics and patterns that we have come to love, in order to inspire many women for our feel good couture.

BNSM,['Footwear'],"BRAND: BNSM DESCRIPTION: What are the advantages of sneakers made of merino wool compared to shoes made of textile and synthetic fibers? In terms of function and comfort, the tried and tested natural fiber is surprisingly in no way inferior to modern high-tech yarns. Thanks to the fine microstructure and strong crimping, it is not scratchy, unlike conventional wool, but rather velvety and silky to the touch. The puffy wool structure ensures good air inclusion with a temperature-regulating effect: Merino wool keeps your feet warm in winter and cool in summer. Merino wool is also very good at absorbing moisture and diverting it to the outside, where it can evaporate quickly. In contrast to synthetic fibers, merino wool is naturally antibacterial and has an odor-inhibiting effect, so that merino sneakers can be worn without socks without any problems. A low weight of merino wool also has a positive effect on the total weight of the merino sneakers. Thanks to the fine, elastic structure of the material, they naturally adapt to the shape of the individual foot, making them more and more comfortable. Wholesale

Bobux,['Footwear'],"BRAND: Bobux DESCRIPTION: In a garage in New Zealand - not unlike other garages where all great inventions are invented, Chris Bennett had a serious challenge ahead of him. He and Bobux co-founder Colleen needed shoes for their baby daughter Chloe, but nothing on the market would do. In that fateful garage, armed with leather, suede and a couple of rubber bands, Chris had an idea - Soft Soles. The first of their kind. He crafted the materials together and finally, Chloe had soft, comfy shoes that let her little feet move naturally. Chris thought other babies might like these gentler, softer non-shoes too, so he took them to the local markets in Auckland where demand went through the roof. By 1997, Bobux found its way across the Tasman and onto the feet of children throughout Australia, and then onto Europe and the US.

Timeline of Bogs Introductions

At Bogs, we know a thing or two about the great outdoors. We actually know way more than a thing or two about the great outdoors, but what’s important to know is that we think the outdoors are great. That’s why they’re called the great outdoors. You probably know that Bogs are from Oregon, the land of lumberjacks, trailblazers, dairy farmers, and cycling baristas with big, bushy beards. They have those beards because Oregon can be wet and cold and gloriously miserable. But with Bogs, your feet are never miserable. Because we have devoted our entire lives to making boots that are lighter and more comfortable than any other boot, in any kind of weather. Then we put them through the kind of testing that you wouldn’t wish on your worst enemy, if you had one. The result? Boots that are warmer, dryer, more comfortable, easier to get on and off, and sometimes cuter, than just about anything you can put on your feet. Because we not only have your back; we have your toes. And your heels and your arches. And most of your ankles, calves and shins, as well. That’s just who we are. We’re Bogs, and we are 100% comfortable in our own boots. And we guarantee that you will be too.

ORIGINAL BOMBERS,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Kidswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: ORIGINAL BOMBERS DESCRIPTION: Before anything else, Bombers Original is a pioneering brand, intimately related to each evolution's key-step of this cult fashion item called Bombers. The iconic navy blue or khaki military jacket was created in the early 50's for the US AirForce's pilots. Since then, it adopted a flashy orange lining, the « warning signal » aimed at facilitating rescue of pilots in distress.

Hence, marketed by a handful of leading brands including Bombers Original, its popularity grew dramatically until it came in a large variety of colours. The short jacket model with puffed sleeves is now a cult article of clothing made famous both by Vietnam veterans and Hollywood's superstars like Marilyn Monroe or James Dean. Hijacked through the years by all the crews who took part in fashion and pop culture's history, from the Mods and Skinheads not to mention Hip-Hop movement's initiators, the Bomber became gradually a must have.

Bombers Original has accompanied each of these cultural changes until the late 90's.However, to the utter despair of purists, the company ceased production at dawn of 2000. And sure enough, Bombers Original rose up from the ashes again, driven by a strong identity and a rich historical background, source of its unquestioned legitimacy.

2007 saw the brand's revival impulsed by a team of young streetwear passionates cradled by the Top Gun soundtrack who cultivate Mods aesthetics. Silent witness of a gradual reappropriation of this menswear classic by big names of rap and techno movement, Bombers Original's team decided to launch a redux version of the legendary garment.

Thanks to its unequivocal name, Bombers Original clearly embodies the Bombers' quintessence. The concept succeeded in ensuring the continuity of an historic brand, while giving it a fresh creative boost, revisiting the timeless classic that Bombers represents and adapting it to the demands of urban clients and trend setting customers.

Bombon de Algodon,"['Womenswear', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: Bombon de Algodon DESCRIPTION: Bombón de algodón, ""Cotton chewable beauty"" was born at the beginning of 2012, when I returned to live in Lima, my birthplace, after six years in Paris and after having completed my studies in fashion at L'Ecole. of the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne and at Mod'Spé Paris. At that time, the supply of ecological and organic clothing for women in Peru was minimal, almost non-existent.
It was a real challenge to launch this eco-responsible fashion project having as main material a relatively unknown and rare material: organic Pima cotton. Its production represents only 3% of world cotton production and only 0.05% is organic.

Today based in Paris, I continue to develop Bombón de algodón.

From the first time I touched an organic Pima cotton jersey at my Bergman / Rivera cotton supplier, I fell in love with this material, what softness!
I have always appreciated noble, natural and precious materials, hence my choice to work specifically with the quality of Pima cotton.
As a result, the clothes in my collections are delicate, particularly soft and very comfortable to wear.
The Pima cotton I work with is GOTS certified organic.

For the winter collections, baby alpaca pieces are added, a fiber as luxurious and representative of my country.

My collections are aimed at the active, independent and sophisticated woman who does not sacrifice style or quality. More specifically, my collections give life to a fun, playful, and flirtatious woman, seeking to make her feel unique with each item of clothing.

I also support good manufacturing practices. The clothes are made in Lima in two workshops: one for cotton clothes and one for alpaca clothes. I have chosen workshops that guarantee a quality of manufacture, remuneration and correct working conditions for the workers.
The idea is to produce a durable garment, by working with quality materials and by focusing on the quality of manufacture.
We produce collections in limited editions; the alpaca line only for the winter season.

By consulting the models that I offer, I invite you to discover my universe. My philosophy ""to make every garment with love"".

From our early beginnings in 1915, as a small manufacturer of women’s hosiery to now as one of Australia’s most iconic brands, we’ve shaped ourselves to fit the needs (and bodies) of Aussie families. From the get-go we've done things a little differently. We were never a company of corporate suits in a stuffy boardroom but a company with our own sports teams, a marching band, a library and even a hairdresser in our early years! In fact, Australia's first industrial psychologists were also an important part of the Bonds family. And this approach was embodied in our company slogan, coined by George Bond himself; ""We don't work for each other. We work with each other"".

We have been handcrafting our BOnova shoes in a small factory in Spain for many years. We produce in environmentally friendly manufacturing processes and with excellent raw materials. October 2012 ...
The two shoe professionals Christoph and Rainer met by chance in Alicante. Both had been responsible for big brands in the shoe business for years. Their professional paths crossed again and again. On this evening in the small tapas bar in Spain, the idea was born to set up our own brand together.
Both were quickly sure in which direction they wanted to develop their dream of their own shoes.
They should be comfortable
They had to be comfortable
Fair production was important to them
The best quality at the best price
The whole thing should always be fashionable
After delicious tapas, lots of red wine and a very long night, BOnova was born. 
The first small collection was launched in March 2013 and BOnova's success story began…. 
Today the two friends are proud and happy how their baby BOnova has developed.

With fancy designs sprinkled with light touches and essential details, Bonpoint styling turns happiness into an everyday lifestyle. Bonpoint is also symbolized by its two iconic little cherries. Charming and instantly recognizable, they evoke the origins of this fashion house. Legend has it that all the family secrets were whispered at La Cerisaie, the founders' family home set amongst the cherry trees in Aix en Provence. 1975 : Marie-France and Bernard Cohen open the first Bonpoint at 67 Rue de l'Université in Paris. 1986 : Marie-France Cohen's sister, Annick Goutal, creates Eau de Bonpoint for children. 2005 : Christine Innamorato takes over the reins from Marie-France Cohen, becoming Bonpoint's Artistic Director. 2007 : The EPI group acquires Bonpoint, enabling it to take off internationally. It now operates 120 stores across 30 countries.

2010 : An extremely natural and hypoallergenic range of skincare products is launched after two years of research. 2018 : the Bristol hotel in Paris introduces Bonpoint products at its spa, inaugurating exclusive treatments designed especially for the well-being of parents and children. At the end of this year, Bonpoint moved its head office from the Rive Gauche to Avenue d'Iéna, in the 16th arrondissement of Paris. This means that the head office, design studio and workshop are all now housed under the same roof for the first time, in an exquisite townhouse that combines tradition with modernity. 2019 : Anne-Valérie Hash is appointed Bonpoint's Artistic Director

There and then, I realised that mothers, like all super heroes, deserve the right gear.

The solution was Boob’s patented nursing collection, which has become a favourite among mothers all over the world. And that was just the beginning. Today we make clothes for all stages of motherhood, with smart double function for pregnancy and nursing. When you buy a garment from Boob, you buy a product that has been produced with care. Some of this you can see and feel for yourself, when you wear our clothes. What may be less obvious is the care we show for everything involved in the production; the people and the environment. To us, it’s a given. Individuals and companies alike, we all have the power to make choices that work either for or against a future. At Boob, we make clothes for the future.

I hope that you will find clothes from us that become favourites in your maternity and nursing wardrobe. When you feel that you no longer have use for your Boob garment, pass it on to a friend, sell it second hand, or give it to a charity. Our clothes are made to be used, washed and loved, over and over again.

BORAGIO,"['Accessories', 'Menswear']","BRAND: BORAGIO DESCRIPTION: On the advice of an acquaintance, who is also a professional expert, who said to them: “If you enter this business, start an exclusive and quality brand for yourself”, the BORAGIO brothers started setting up their own company during their studies . And with success. In five years time, Boragio has grown from 30 pants to a production and sale of 10,000 pants per year. Boragio now has 40 stores and the brand has also managed to reach the international market. Boragio is very popular among celebrities, such as rappers, influencers and football players. During his internship in 2015, the youngest brother researched price-quality ratios, models, target groups and trends in the fashion market. It was this internship assignment that sparked the ambition to start on his own. The BORAGIO brothers started their own jeans line in 2015. The extensive market research that came about during the internship turned out to be a good starting point for the start of the company.

A very important learning experience was the many years of experience they gained with their professional expert, who himself worked for many years in the textile and denim industry for large international groups. In addition, the brothers grew up in production, which ensured that the two learned at a very young age what is involved in a denim production company. From unloading the trucks to quality control and reconditioning, by the time the BORAGIO brothers brought their brand to the market, they already had an enormous amount of knowledge and experience.

Bracha,"['Bags', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Bracha DESCRIPTION: The story of Piña
From waste product to multifunctional substance fabric

Marieke 
Corona affects us all. And yet in addition to the many sad messages, there is also light on the horizon, at least on mine. As founder and owner of Brächa Design, I try to live my core values every day; to propagate freedom, creativity and sustainability. As a person, but also through my business. I designed and produced sustainable and ‘fair’ leather bags. I didn’t do this alone, but together with a local community in Bali. This way I not only produced a beautiful product, I also provided an income for a group of local employees and their families. I have been doing this for several years in addition to my profession as a hairstylist. In my work I can fully express my creativity and my need for freedom and sustainability. Corona as a game changer
With the arrival of Corona everything changed. The number of orders decreased quickly, and I was no longer able to visit Bali to consult with my team. I soon realized that producing more bags was not the solution. Corona forced me to slow down, to reflect. On the one hand that was annoying and uncertain. For me, but also for the people I work with in Bali. On the other hand, space and time arose. For some years now I have been looking for even more durable material than the leather I use now, even though we are already doing it as sustainable as possible. I have experimented with vegan and therefore vegetable leather.
But that didn't quite get off the ground. On the one hand because it is a costly matter and on the other because I learned that many 'vegan' fabrics are not completely vegan and so that
didn't feel right.

And then a couple of months ago things changed. I met an Indonesian social entrepreneur, who offered help and some funding and so I was able to start experimenting with pineapple, together with a group of local workers. We already knew that you could do a lot with the leaf of a pineapple, which is a waste product. You only need a good machine. Knowing that
this machine is only produced in China and that buying and shipping was too expensive, we decided to produce this machine ourselves and so the first ""trials"" could begin.

It takes a village to make Piña! 
We quickly developed an effective local chain. I am always amazed by the local creativity and ""Can-do"" mentality. There are people who collect the leaves, others who transport them and still others who run them through the machine. We also train people on how to use the machine. Soon we got the hang of the process and were able to develop a very sturdy, beautiful fabric, with which anything is possible. We baptized the name into PIÑA! At the moment we are producing all different kinds of fabric, we doubled our machines and our production and committed a great group of local people.

The challenge for me is not only developing the material. Managing and developing the people involved is a major challenge. How do I ensure that they meet the quality
requirements that are necessary, but also that they will receive a structural income now and in the future? They are so enthusiastic and have a lot of ideas, but how do you temper that local enthusiasm so that we can first improve and grow? The last thing I want is to lose the local passion.

Who needs Piña?
Who can benefit from Piña, who do we address? We want to reach conscious designers who, together with us, want to get even more out of this material. Think of clothing, fabric for furniture, accessories, covers for surfboards, tent cloth, etc. We want to reach people who are looking for a need sturdy multifunctional fabric, but also want to develop it further with us. We are looking for people who want to innovate sustainably and contribute to a better world. We believe that we need to grab this opportunity today! And yes, because everything is partly made by hand and because it is a natural product, it also requires patience and respect. Purchases can be made per meter and together we can further personalize the fabric, color and use.

Firm steps 
In the coming months we will take the time to professionalize the process and further develop the material. Trial and error, but always with a solid step forward. Follow my journey or travel with me? Feel free to reach out!

The future collections remain true to the typical BRAEND look and feel, even while heading more to the sportive side with classic sneakers and casual-dressed shoes with popping colours.

Brave Soles are beautiful, handmade shoes with upcycled tire soles. Our accessories lines also contain all elements of upcycled goodness, from leather to motorbike inner tube accents. 
We are female owned, ethically produced and globally inspired.
We believe in the power of sustainable fashion to build a future we can all enjoy, together. 
Our products are handmade in Dominican Republic. We partner with local artisans and suppliers using small scale production and local employment. As the founder of an international youth humanitarian organization, Christal Earle had been working and learning from a local community of garbage dump workers since 2005 on the north coast of Dominican Republic.
Among everything else in that garbage dump, there was also an overwhelming amount of tires. They were a breeding ground for mosquitoes carrying deadly diseases and they were a toxic nightmare.
In 2010, an unexpected turn of events in Christal’s journey left her facing the fact that she was going to have to rebuild her life between two countries. She was now torn between Canada, where her career was based ,and Dominican Republic where her adopted daughter couldn’t leave.
In early 2017, the idea struck for the first time. Why not use tires for soles on beautiful hand made shoes - and create a way to help the most vulnerable people in the process?

Bretelle & Braces,['Accessories'],"BRAND: Bretelle & Braces DESCRIPTION: It all began in the garage under the house, where in 2004, the brothers Rosanna and Mirco Merlo, already in the accessories sales sector for thirty years, created Bretelle & Braces. The watchword is care for tradition, typical of the best Made in Italy.
This is how the accessory that will soon become a cult in clothing takes shape: the suspenders.

It starts to produce and sell in its own territory, the Veneto, to then expand into the rest of Italy.

The leap in quality takes place with participation in Pitti, an international fair in the men's fashion sector.

The product is also immediately noticed by foreign buyers, specifically by oriental ones who especially appreciate Made in Italy.

The aim of Bretelle & Braces is the attention to detail, so the best metal parts, the best leathers and the best silks are used to create exclusive braces.

To the production of the suspenders are added the belts, which are all strictly hand-woven, both the elastic ones and the leather ones, as well as the buckles are covered in leather.

2014 sees the entry into the company of Annamaria and Massimiliano (Mirco's children) who bring their know-out and expand the production with clutches and bow ties to match the suspenders.

With them we fly to New York and Berlin, to participate in the international trade fairs Mrket and Premium .

In 2018 they launch a new challenge and present themselves at the Pitti Bimbo fair, with braces and belts for the little ones, always refined accessories with attention to the smallest details like any product under the Bretelle & Braces brand.

A last look at the world of accessories and thus also the production of gloves, an accessory symbol of elegance; and, as always, the focus is still on quality.

Bricktown,['Menswear'],"BRAND: Bricktown DESCRIPTION: Bricktown itself started as an Art project. I have developed the entire brand on a vision: one of a pixelated world. I picture everything under the light of the digital pixel and my goal is to create a something like a big library of digital artwork representing the world culture, where everyone can find its own. From a juicy burger, or  a shiny spaceship, to iconic video game characters anyone can find something that represents their own tastes, and in which they can recognize themselves. The end result is the pixelation of the entire world, where passions and tastes gather in their core originality. The choice to make pixels the core element at the basis of the brand blooms directly out of my childhood: video games, the arrival of the internet and the digital world, in general, are the supporting columns of the 90s. As soon as they came out, pixels quickly became the foundation for the creaction of digital art. Just think a little bit about it – those days, every image you see on a screen is made with millions of pixels… And you no longer see them, but they are all here in front of you.

In this branch of Art everything comes down to pixels: they are, and always will be, the colorful foundations of the Digital World and the Virtual Reality itself.
By using pixels for my Art, I captured the true essence of Digital Art History.

Briggs Riley,['Bags'],"BRAND: Briggs Riley DESCRIPTION: OUR STORY

Three little words...Engineered for reality.

When you’re traveling, they can mean the difference between fast or frantic, relaxed or riled. You see, at Briggs & Riley we do what many consider unthinkable these days. We listen. To customers, to retail partners, to our team of repair experts. Then we design our bags around real-world needs and wants. A handle mounted on the outside of a bag to create more room and flat packing. A pocket to hold toiletries or safeguard your passport. An expansion system that adds capacity then compresses your belongings securely in place. In fact, we have multiple patents designed to make travel, well, easier. It’s innovative thinking like this—never for innovation’s sake—that sets Briggs & Riley apart. Now combine all that with the only unconditional lifetime guarantee in the business. It’s no wonder our customers are nothing short of fanatical about our bags. History
A little bit about us...

Briston Watches,['Jewelry'],"BRAND: Briston Watches DESCRIPTION: Because time flies, because there are sometimes special moments that are conducive to changes of course in life, because you have to follow your dreams to the end, Brice Jaunet creates his own brand of watches after 15 years of experience in the watch industry. During these years, he worked in the two largest watchmaking groups in the world, starting with Richemont, where he started at Cartier. He moved to Baume & Mercier, then internationally to Raymond Weil. He finally joined the LVMH group as export director for the Zenith brand, then as vice-president of international marketing, before taking over the management of the brand in France.

Cradled from his earliest childhood by an entrepreneurial spirit, that of his grandfather Jacques, co-founder of the NewMan brand in 1967, Brice has always had the ambition to bring his creativity to life.

It was therefore at the end of 2012 that he set out, collaborating with Swiss designer friends, to create a watch brand that resembled him, the fruit of his reflections, his research and the desire to create a beautiful watchmaking work, authentic but accessible.

His studies in Oxford, his passion for sport and his taste for travel instilled in the Briston brand its “sport chic” spirit, a bit offbeat.

Brunotti,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Sportswear', 'Swimwear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Brunotti DESCRIPTION: In November just passed, I was lucky enough to join Hans and Vinny Schaap on a road trip through Scotland. It can sometimes be a blessing in disguise when the waves aren′t as good as anticipated. You spend more time acknowledging and appreciating your new surroundings and exploring different areas that you might not have visited otherwise. The surf Gods were not on our side this trip. As amazing and versatile as the waves are in Scotland, it can be equally as unpredictable. The swells were coming in on the wrong angle for the particular coast we were on, meaning we were left to head out to the Orkney Islands in search of relief. Home to some amazing setups, we got to enjoy a couple of surfs, but winds and tides kept us land docked for most of our stay. As we were en route to get the ferry back to the mainland on sunset, we crossed this bridge only to look down and see head high right hander peeling from a cool little point break bay type setup. Not in a million years when looking at a map would you expect to find waves there, but the direction and size of the swell had it wrapping in perfectly. Getting dark and having no time to waste before the ferry, we had to swallow it and keep driving. That′s the beauty of travel, you sometimes have to learn the hard way and it helps prepares you for next time. Back on the mainland, we did have one fun surf under a mystical castle on the east coast that was incredibly scenic.

Wave starved, we found ourselves looking for thrills other ways. Majority of the trip it felt like we were standing on big open cliff faces. Scotland is so raw and beautiful and absurdly cold.We spent loads of time on the road singing to Pete Murray and tons of 80s playlists. Hans would cook up oatmeal porridge every morning for breakfast which I had no arguments about.

The car was an absolute beast. It had a personality of its own, like the 4th member of the trip. It was so loud at first I contemplated buying a set of industrial ear muffs to avoid damaging my ears, but after a while it became soothing. It felt like driving a spaceship to begin with, there were 5 or more mechanical things you had to complete before she started, but by the end, we had all fell in love with it. There were 2 good bed options and one narrow long bed which we named 'the spine'. Every night we would play scissor paper rock to see who would be relegated to the spine for the night. Vinny, Hans and I are not the shortest lads either so there was some serious repercussions on the line.",https://www.brunotti.com,"{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.8, 'pos': 0.14, 'compound': 0.9921}",0.9921,Positive,en

So we all will be able to progress a lot faster, which is the core motivation of the life which releases certain chemicals in our brains and creates the feeling of happiness.

If you can truely see what you look at, you just realize all that information is hidden in the nature. Much the same it is in a single ‘random’ splash on a clean canvas.

There, he started drawing; the connection between two beings and something heavy, to keep him grounded in this life. Together with a local silversmith he brought those sketches to life; the brand and its first bracelet were born. Ever since, we create our silver masterpieces with the best craftsmen we can find. Buddha to Buddha prides itself that each piece of jewellery is made by hand. Therefore every piece is unique, each piece has a soul. Embrace life
Today Buddha to Buddha is more than just jewellery. It’s a lifestyle; embracing life and its contradictions. We challenge the fast-paced life, the never-not-working-life and the so-many-impulses-I-don’t-actually-see-anything-life. We try to pause, connect back to the world and care for those in it. Stand still and be inspired to see the things you overlook. We are for the passionate, the creatives, the risktakers and the rebels. Why the rush? Explore the world, embrace the unknown and let life surprise you.

Craft & Quality
Craftsmanship is at the core of Buddha to Buddha’s premium jewellery. From the design process to development, a team of designers, developers and silversmiths work together to create the finished piece. The chain big bracelet (size E) takes a skilled silversmith around five days to complete, including the clasp, which is made up of 28 intricate pieces. Even the leather on the designs is handwoven by talented leather workers.
Whether it’s a ring, a bracelet or a necklace, each piece is the result of a long and meticulous process involving creative minds, infinite patience and very steady hands.

Burberry,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Burberry DESCRIPTION: Burberry is a British luxury brand, headquartered in London.

Since being founded in 1856, Burberry has been guided by the core belief that Creativity Opens Spaces. From developing outerwear that allowed daring men and women to surpass the limits of human endeavour to being a luxury pioneer in the digital space, our purpose is to unlock the power of imagination to push boundaries and open new possibilities for our people, our customers and our communities. Thomas Burberry was just 21 years old when he founded his outfitting business in Basingstoke, England. However, it was in 1879 that he secured his legacy as a visionary and innovator with his invention of gabardine. Before the advent of the fabric, outerwear worn to protect against the often inclement British weather tended to be made from rubber, oil and wax. After hearing from a doctor that it was better to get wet through rather than stay dry in such clothing as it was odorous, hot and believed to induce ill-health, Thomas Burberry set out to create a breathable and weatherproof alternative. His invention, gabardine, revolutionised rainwear. The open spaces in the weave of the fabric allowed airflow and made for lightweight and comfortable garments. 

Such was the fabric’s reputation that in 1893 Norwegian polar explorer, zoologist and recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, Dr Fridtjof Nansen, took Burberry gabardine with him when he set sail bound for the Arctic Circle. Many more explorers and adventurers turned to Burberry gabardine in the years that followed. Gabardine is still used in the manufacture of Burberry Heritage Trench Coats today. 

Affectionately known as “Old Tom”, Thomas Burberry was described by his employees as “the kindest of chiefs”. During his lifetime he devoted significant time to humanitarian causes and gave generously to local charities. He was considered to have been thoughtful and ambitious, and was said to have conducted his career through “straightforward dealings and sound principles”. 

He retired in 1917 but remained on the Board of Burberrys Ltd until his death in 1926 at the age of 90.

Burlington,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Sportswear']","BRAND: Burlington DESCRIPTION: Whether a traditional Argyle pattern or an on-trend product, seasonal items or holiday socks – every mood, every style and every occasion are brought together with Burlington. Not least on account of the creative pattern and the variety and intensity of the colours, we stand for modern lifestyle products, and thus enable the creation of a fashion statement and an unmistakeable look. The originality and uniqueness of the Burlington brand are emphasized by the typical Burlington clip stud. Our traditional Argyle pattern, the diamond with the over check, is deeply rooted in British history. As early as the 18th century, it was known as a symbol of affiliation with the Scottish clans. The most powerful of these clans, the Campbells of Argyll, ultimately made this pattern popular on socks. The individuality and boldness of this style are an expression of an exclusive lifestyle, which has proven popular all over the world; something that continues even to this day. In this way, the Brit style is given an international interpretation, and playfully engages with tradition.

Since 2008 under the umbrella of FALKE KGaA, the product quality has been constantly perfected, and the sock trend has been shaped ever since. In Europe, and in the brand's hometown of Schmallenberg, high-quality materials are crafted into original Burlington products.

Busnel,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Busnel DESCRIPTION: In France 1920, Busnel was created and established by Monsieur and Madame Busnel. Initially by first building their own factory at the west coast of France, possessing their wish to create a lifestyle brand with the highest quality of wool. The fisherman’s sweater became an important trademark and representation for the brand. Busnel also supplied the French army with knitted products, during the second world war between 1939-1945. Thereafter, Anita Falkenberg brought Busnel to Scandinavia. 1970 she established the agency for the brand located in Stockholm, and consequently Scandinavia became the leading market between the decades of 1970-2000. When Anita first introduced Busnel in Sweden, the knitted Victoria Jacket with golden anchor buttons became a significant symbol for the breakthrough of the modern woman during the 70's. Busnel’s heritage is essential, as the focus still lays on high quality, luxury fabrics and clean silhouettes for the chic and sophisticated woman. With intention to combine the authentic French heritage with fashion characteristics of new thinking and responsibility for production standards.

In 2009 Anita Falkenberg’s daughter Louise Falkenberg bought Busnel, aiming to carefully rejuvenate the brand. The following years, Busnel has continued to grow and the main focus is still slow fashion and high quality wool that will last a lifetime. Also, Busnel develop and add new qualities and styles every season to complete the collections. Today 2020, Busnel is a well-known brand in Scandinavia, with a growing position on the European market. Uniquely, with a production of the knitted wool styles in the same factory with the same wool supplier that was established 1920 by Monsieur and Madame Busnel at the west coast of France.

Byredo conceives objects using the highest quality materials available, and high-end design details to fuel a renewed approach to modern luxury.

A native Swede, born to an Indian mother and a Canadian father, Ben grew up in Toronto, New York and Stockholm. He graduated from the Stockholm art school with a degree in fine arts, but a chance meeting with perfumer Pierre Wulff convinced him that he'd rather create fragrances than paintings. 

With no formal training in the field, Gorham, 31 years old , sought out the services of world renowned perfumers Olivia Giacobetti and Jerome Epinette, explaining his olfactory desires and letting them create the compositions. 

As an outsider in the beauty industry, Ben is somewhat of an anomaly and has been recognized for his personal style and connection to fashion and art in several international magazines such as French Vogue, Vanity Fair, Elle, V Magazine and Fantastic Man to name a few.

Cabaia,"['Bags', 'Bodywear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Cabaia DESCRIPTION: In February 2015 Bastien was wearing the pompom hat that his grandmother had knitted for him when he lost it in the Paris metro. 

He then looked for a replacement but found only dreary, soulless and shoddy hats. 

Entrepreneur at heart, Bastien then had the idea of ​​a brand that resembles him, jovial and honest, whose mission is to put a good mood in the accessories and in the life of whoever wears them. He then created our first concept: The beanie bar!

Emilien

In the winter of 2015 at the other end of Paris, while Bastien was still looking for his hat, Emilien was deeply bored in his job as a nuclear engineer, too regulated, too slow, not creative enough and therefore decided to mount a first company which he closed after a year.

During an aperitif, Emilien, who was looking for a new project in which to invest, met Bastien. The duo therefore joined forces (after many glasses of wine) and Emilien infused Cabaïa with his commitment to animals and created our motto “serious is boring”, a nod to his old work.

Cache Coeur,"['Accessories', 'Bodywear', 'Jewelry', 'Maternity wear', 'Womenswear']","BRAND: Cache Coeur DESCRIPTION: Cache Coeur is the French company specialist for future moms. The story starts in 2008 when husband and wife, Philippe and Audrey Trolliet, decide to revolutionize the maternity and nursing lingerie. Their force relies on a precious symbiosis. On one hand, Audrey’s exceptional skills and creativity as a former corset maker for the greatest French brands, and on the other hand, Philippe’s experience in business and management after 15 years working in mass market retailing.

Cache Coeur was born after designer Audrey had longs talks with friends of hers, about how difficult it is for a pregnant woman to get feminine maternity and nursing lingerie. That’s what the brand aims at changing. We don’t just do bras for mom-to-be; we offer true maternity and nursing lingerie, with traditional technics and refinement.

The use of the best Italian fabrics facilitates the task, thanks to their lightness, their comfort and the sense of well being that they transmit to the wearer.

Cadini is present in all continents, in single-brand stores and luxury boutiques. The brand is synonymous with high quality products, innovation, in the name of tradition, and reliability.

CAFE LEATHER,"['Bags', 'Accessories']","BRAND: CAFE LEATHER DESCRIPTION: At Café we base our philosophy on three pillars: the search for authenticity, a passion for the small details, and respect for well-made things. Café is our way of understanding life expressed through authentic products. Products made by the best artisan hands of Ubrique (Spain) and with the best raw materials on the market. One of our secrets lies in the use of the best 100% vegetable-tanned leather. All our processes are environmentally friendly. Tired of buying products with clearly planned obsolescence, and in that eagerness to produce cheaper and faster, we seem to forget one of the most important things in any product: The soul.
Since then, our mission has been to bring back all these good traditions. That way of doing things that our grandparents had when time was slower and details were everything. Focus on doing things to last, with care, and always looking for the best sustainable raw materials. Materials where all the senses come into play, except for the taste (although sometimes we have been tempted to try our leather in a salad or something similar).

Cake Maternity,"['Accessories', 'Bodywear', 'Swimwear']","BRAND: Cake Maternity DESCRIPTION: Cake was born out of our founder, Tracey Montford’s own personal struggle during her pregnancy journey. In her search for comfortable, functional and stylish maternity and nursing wear, it appeared hitting all three was the trifecta that didn’t exist. She was disheartened to find that in becoming a mother, she’d inadvertently have to give up her own sense of personal style. Suddenly in this new role, she was being forced into this one-size-fits-all mould of how a mother should look—and it wasn’t pretty. And who on earth said you couldn’t look gorgeous whilst breastfeeding, was that such a crime? In 2007, apparently, it was. She wanted more and realised that if she felt this way, so must many other women across the world. This became her driving force to create beautiful, high quality, functional and comfortable pieces that help to support mothers on their breastfeeding journey. From our humble beginnings, operating out of a Sydney garage to being stocked around the globe, it’s safe to say she was right.

To this day, Tracey has that same passion and vision driving her, encouraging women to breastfeed for as long as possible in a supported & educated community.

Calou,"['Footwear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Calou DESCRIPTION: It all began back in 2005 when I was in Italy working with a jewellery collection. Little did I expect that my life was about to take a different turn. Outside my native Sweden, I started to look at my comfortable wooden clogs in a new light. Swedish clogs, with their characteristic shape and the tradition of Swedish craftsmanship suddenly seemed exotic and full of possibilities. I started to think about decorating them, using new materials and techniques, embossing the leather, and producing different styles and colours. I had no idea how timely I was – clogs were about to have a major revival. Today Calou Stockholm , Swedish clogs, has developed into an international shoe company. While our roots are still firmly in the Swedish clog tradition and genuine craftsmanship, we have gone on to include clog boots, and even high heeled clogs in our collections. All are made in cushioned, flexible materials which make our shoes incredibly comfortable to wear. We are passionate about our clogs!

Camille,"['Bags', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: Camille DESCRIPTION: At Camille, we do everything possible to adopt an eco-responsible production method.

SLOW FASHION
Choosing a responsible mode of consumption means choosing not to work according to the seasons but rather to prefer timeless and quality fashion . It is also making the choice not to practice sales and to sell good products at the right price all year round. AN ECO-RESPONSIBLE APPROACH
We strive to limit our plastic consumption as much as possible, in particular by promoting the use of recycled paper for our packaging. We also favor more environmentally friendly materials for our bags.

MANUFACTURING
All Camille bags are made in a small family workshop located in the Paris region . As a result, we are at the heart of the manufacturing process and can more easily be present at each of its stages. Also, we limit our carbon footprint by avoiding the air transport of goods and we can use public transport to visit our workshops.

SOURCING
We promote local sourcing as much as possible and favor suppliers closest to Paris. As far as possible, we work with French weavers (for jacquards and linings) and, if this is not possible, favor European partners.

ETHICAL BAGS
We have decided not to use leather both for obvious animal protection and ethical reasons but also for environmental concerns. Thus, all of our bags are Peta Approved and vegan.  

THE CHOICE OF MATERIALS  / VEGAN MATERIALS
To do this, we use several innovative and sustainable materials such as Piñatex and Apple Skin as well as synthetic fibers and Okeo-Tex certified jacquards.

Coming from a shoemaker family, Fluxà used his knowledge of traditional craftsmanship as the basis for the new, daring brand.

The Fluxà family is deeply involved in innovative craftsmanship, and that long-term involvement began in 1877, when Lorenzo's grandfather, Antonio Fluxà, a skilled shoemaker, traveled from Mallorca to England. When he returned, he brought with him sewing machines that were not yet known on the island, and radically changed the traditional shoemaking craft.

At just 17 years old, Salvatore Capezio opened a small shoe repair shop only a few pirouettes away from New York’s old Metropolitan Opera House. The sign above his door read, “The Theatrical & Historical Shoemaker.” He began his business by repairing theatrical shoes for the Met. Salvatore quickly made the transition from cobbler to shoemaker when he made an emergency pair of shoes for Polish opera star, Jean de Reszke. He discovered pointe shoes to be a challenging balance between delicate construction and complex engineering. In turn, his customers discovered that few shoemakers were as determined as Capezio to take on that challenge.

Capo,['Accessories'],"BRAND: Capo DESCRIPTION: CAPO’s corporate history has always been closely associated with the raw materials to be found in nature. We realised the benefits of these at an early stage. Soon we added innovative processing methods and more sophisticated materials. 1912 – straw hats for the Hapsburg monarchy, paper hats during the First World War; felt hats from 1938 on, hay hats and girardi hats starting in the mid-fifties, fashionable cloth caps for winter wear from the seventies; and today – innovative headwear that has been ‘inspired by nature’.

The Bregenzerwald – the Bregenz Forest – was our home base. It is a farming region. People’s lives here have always been based on the seasons. In the winter months, embroidery work was crucial to survival – as well as a hat factory.

Capslab,"['Accessories', 'Menswear']","BRAND: Capslab DESCRIPTION: Not long ago in a galaxy not far away, the crazy professor, ""Doc Labos"", was searching for the formula for capturing the powers of all our favorite heroes and transferring them to caps. A hint of nostalgia, a good dose of geek and a generous handful of colors : these are the ingredients that were necessary for the development of this formula. But it was missing the most important element: the heroes.

Labos contacted his lifelong friend, Dr. Emmett Brown, who lent him his DeLorean.With this, he was able to travel through time to capture one-by-one all the heroes he needed (and who were even more numerous than he had imagined)!

Some heroes, like the Care Bears or the Pink Panther were pretty easy to capture, but it was a different story for Superman, Iron Man and Sangoku.

Carven,"['Womenswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Carven DESCRIPTION: Madame Carven founded her Maison de Couture in 1945 at the end of the war. Conscious of the realities of the era, she designed clothes that were refined yet carefree, inaugurating the era of ready-to-wear.

Her designs were immediately met with success. Her green-and-white striped cotton fabric which was launched with the “Ma Griffe” dress became a signature of the house.

Born in 1909, Marie-Louise Carven married Phillipe Mallet – the renowned architect Robert Mallet-Stevens’ brother who designed the Villa Noailles in Hyères, in 1938. Carven studied architecture at the Beaux Arts which remained a passion when she became a couturier and informed her patterns and constructions. Her first creations were for herself. As she found no designs to her taste at the fashion houses of the time, she created her own. She gave pride of place to materials that were not commonly used at the time: pink gingham, broderie anglaise and Indian cottons.

Carven was spontaneous and inspired by youth. She developed practical designs, worlds apart from the conservative vision of couture in Paris. She favoured comfort over ornaments. The Carven style become popular both in the street and in the fashion magazines.

An enthusiastic traveller, she made several trips around the world over a period of five decades, to promote her designs. She exported the image of the modern Parisian woman to the US, Brazil, the Middle-East and Asia.

In 2002, the Palais Galliera, dedicated a major retrospective to Madame Carven, celebrating the mark she left on fashion. Affectionately nicknamed the “smallest of the big designers”, she retired after 50 years as a couturier. She passed away in 2015 at the age of 105.

In September 2021, the flagship Carven store opened at the 6 Rond-Point des Champs-Elysées in the very location where Madame Carven made her debut.

CASHMERE COUTURE - SIMONE BRUNS,"['Womenswear', 'Kidswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: CASHMERE COUTURE - SIMONE BRUNS DESCRIPTION: Simone Bruns has become a prominent figure in the international arts – and charity arena. With several, often spectacular events and auctions she managed to raise 1.5 million Euros for various good causes. A great success has been her 2014 photography auction on behalf of “Welthungerhilfe“, through which she gathered 200 000 Euros for Sierra Leone. 

The funds were used to support local farmers recultivate their land for growing organic cocoa, helping them to compete on a global market and achieve more sustainable livelihoods. Simone Bruns describes this experience as a personal and professional turning point: “being able to help people on the other side of the world by using my network has been incredibly rewarding“. In 2015, Simone Bruns founded her fashion label “CASHMERE COUTURE / SIMONE BRUNS“. Deeply touched by the crisis unfolding, she travelled to Nepal after the earthquake in April and began to draw a global alliance with rural Cashmere producers. Due to widespread illiteracy, many peoples livelihood depends on their ability to produce Cashmere threads. Simone Bruns goal is to create long term and sustainable professional perspectives in Nepal, particularly for women.

Simone Bruns' work begins at home with the development of her fashion collections.  Back in the Himalayas, the female workers implement her designs under supervision of a local employee. Each uniquely handmade item receives a serial number before it gets send to Germany. The women receive a monthly wage significantly above the average Nepalese income. It is Simone Bruns deepest wish to reach as many women as possible for this exclusive cooperation. “Our products are unique and luxurious highlights in every woman's closet.

Castart,['Menswear'],"BRAND: Castart DESCRIPTION: It’s a though balance these days, between staying true to yourself and standing out in an ultra- violent crowd. Those who want to express themselves in a subtle way, are often forgotten. Something that's more difficult than it might seem, in a fashion scenery where color is often undervalued for men. For this reason, Castart wants to create something unlike the rest they’ve seen so far. Castart, the French word for a cheeky man, launched its first collection in 2018 and has been busy rediscovering itself and inventing new stuff ever since. They work closely with the factories to strive for new developments within qualitative but also sustainable products. Producing pieces only in an ethnic way that fit their personal values, with an international orientation, the main focus remains a personal approach. Compared to other materials being sold massively online, clothes are something else. You have to try, feel and get to know a piece before you can truly connect with it. Items that are as strong in quality as the story it has to tell, is even more outspoken.
Based on these core values, Castart finds its inspiration in both everyday things - such as helping the headstrong man by using clothes as a way to express himself - as well as in more artistic disciplines. As such, each collection starts from a creative theme. For example, the outspoken colors in the paintings of Mark Rothko were one of the primary sources of inspiration for Castart. Later, the artistic movement Bauhaus formed the first blueprints for the winter collection. Seeking on the timeline of art history for subjects, Castart looks for themes and colors that fit their story. But other artistic disciplines such as architecture or music, or even movies and installations, can also be used to start from. Finally, the definite creative line that runs through the collection is a consistent story which gives the label this unique familiar flow.

Castelijn & Beerens,"['Bags', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Castelijn & Beerens DESCRIPTION: Since 1945 Castelijn & Beerens briefcases, purses and belts are a family business! The traditional company from Netherlands focuses on best leather that is tanned naturally and coloured by hand. The result is a modern understatement in luxury quality! The bags and briefcases by Castelijn & Beerens provide a lot of space for technical equipment and documents but they are a straightforward, authentic highlight for your business look as well. A love of leather

Our products are made with only the best possible full grain bovine leather. Each and every skin is carefully hand-selected. Then, working closely with specialist tanneries, we give it the exact shine, colour, and hand-feel that our products require. Anything less than perfect is rejected. It’s a meticulous, painstaking regime that is driven by a genuine love of leather.

Class with durability

We want our leather products to not only look and feel good, they should also be durable and long lasting. That’s why our metal logos, buckles, snap hooks, and push buttons are made from high quality nickel-free alloy. Our metal zippers have polished teeth. And our linings are backed with a protective coating. Everything has to look good, and stay good.

Taking care

Leather is a rich and durable natural material that actually improves with age. Treat it well and you’ll enjoy it for many years. Although our leather bags are protected with a water-resistant coating, we advise that if yours gets rain splashed, dry it off with a soft cloth. To keep it clean, supple and conditioned we recommend the care product “Carbon Wax Spray”.",https://www.castelijnenbeerens.com,"{'neg': 0.014, 'neu': 0.705, 'pos': 0.281, 'compound': 0.9981}",0.9981,Positive,en

Castori,['Footwear'],"BRAND: Castori DESCRIPTION: The brand Castori was born in 2008 by the will and ability of the Salerno-entrepreneur, Vito Viscido, whose background and long history in the clothing industry drove his desire to pay homage to his origins by shaping the ideal shoe. The shoes are fruit of a deep appreciation of beauty that the entrepreneur breathes and cultivates in the family since childhood, with knowledge that a product has a value, not a price. It is Vito Viscido’s maternal grandfather Carlo who imparted his passion for footwear. Young Vito, in his grandfather’s house, lovingly watched as he pulled his shoes out of the closet with love; he cleaned, polished and had them resoled. They were all custom-made shoes and nobody could touch them. “The shoes come alive when you polish them” said grandfather Carlo, who willingly avoided dirt roads, preferring the paved ones, as not to ruin his shoes. He repeatedly told his grandson: “Vito! Life is like shoes: few things, but well-made! “ His grandfather’s  masterpieces were kept in a shoe cabinet, under lock and key. The key’s handle is now the logo of the Castori brand: a symbol of knowledge, perseverance and curiosity.

Our prints themselves celebrate icons of our culture, like London red buses, English garden roses (which you'll find painted on mugs of tea all over).

Cavallo,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Sportswear', 'Footwear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Cavallo DESCRIPTION: Cavallo - The premium equestrian brand
Inspiration and innovation are our passion.

Cavallo was founded in Bad Oeynhausen in 1978 and quickly became the market leader in riding boots. Today, Cavallo is one of the highest-profile brands in international equestrian sport. In addition to riding boots, the range also includes ankle boots, chaps, leisure shoes and accessories such as spur straps, boot bags and care products. In the 2000s, Cavallo introduced a functional riding clothing collection for the first time. This comprises two fixed collections per year, one for spring/summer from March and one for autumn/winter. All Cavallo collections are characterised by a fashionable style and high functionality. The collections included breeches, sportswear and accessories as well as the right equipment for the horse, perfectly colour-coordinated with the seasonal equestrian clothing. In addition, a fixed VIP programme was introduced, which includes so-called ""never out of stock"" items. Cavallo also has a wide range of competition clothing for riders and horses.

In addition, the brand occasionally surprises its customers with small interim collections, such as the Premium Capsule and the Ingrid Klimke collection. These complement the range and offer additional choice for riders looking for exclusive, high-quality products.

Cavallo is the brand for high-quality equipment that combines function and fashion. Together, this ensures that the premium equestrian brand is held in high regard and that Cavallo products are favoured by national and international equestrian enthusiasts.

CELINE,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Accessories', 'Bags']","BRAND: CELINE DESCRIPTION: When it was announced that Hedi Slimane was appointed to helm Celine, there was no doubt in anyone’s mind that he would swiftly revamp the minimalist label that Phoebe Philo had so carefully constructed during her tenure as creative director. That assumption was proven just a few weeks ago, when Slimane debuted an accent-less Celine logo. And it comes as no surprise; he is the bad boy of fashion, a reputation he rightly earned after completely overhauling Yves Saint Laurent in 2012. For some, the Celine news was met with glee and anticipation. For others—the Philophiles, namely—it was not. Just ahead of Slimane’s debut of the new Celine (the Spring 2019 show is slated to present at 8:30 p.m. on Sept. 28 during Paris Fashion Week), those changes are already starting to show: the announcement of a men’s line and couture collection, a newly scrubbed Instagram account, and a new bag called “Le 16” that Slimane had evidently conceived on the first day of his new role.

Cerruti,['Menswear'],"BRAND: Cerruti DESCRIPTION: At the tender age of 20, Nino Cerruti took over the family business. Filled with vision and an expert in production procedures, he began to modernise the textile manufacturer to incorporate clothing production.

Given the norms of bespoke tailoring at the time, Nino sparked waves in the fashion community when he launched a men’s ready-to-wear collection in 1957. This introduction received widespread coverage in the press and the public hailed it as a revolution; a confident departure from fashion norms and one that paved the way for the future for menswear.

Charismatic and talented, Nino Cerruti was drawn to the grand stage of Paris, the then undisputed fashion capital of the world. In 1967, he established Cerruti 1881, the luxury ready-to-wear line for men. Today, Cerruti 1881 produces an extensive line of ready-to-wear menswear that remains true to the brand’s distinctive ethos of fine fabrics, meticulous craftsmanship and intelligent design.

The range of products under the brand includes fragrances, leather goods, watches, jewellery, eyewear, ties, scarves, shoes, writing instruments, underwear, socks, nightwear and loungewear.

While remaining true to the brand’s distinctive ethos of fine fabrics, meticulous craftsmanship and intelligent design in its offerings, Cerruti 1881 has embraced innovation and creativity to become the quintessential contemporary menswear brand.

Champagne in the Morning,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Champagne in the Morning DESCRIPTION: As an artist it is necessary not to conform. Unjudged and open-minded about life, I’m outside of society. But with three kids, a marriage and everyday obligations, I’m also in the middle of this.

Ambivalence is key. No yin without yang, no kiss without Smint and no Kanye without Kim. Champagne in the Morning is just that. Literally consuming alcohol in the morning, nice but on a daily basis not realistic. On the other hand, it also means “Fuck you”, I do exactly what I want and I’ll do it my way. That feeling of victory can be achieved in many ways.

Example a): You are sitting at your desk in the office and decide to go to the bathroom. Got a cup of coffee, plugged in your airpods and watch an episode of your favorite series righ there. Bam! That’s the right feeling: Champagne in the Morning.

Example b): Get a tattoo of a toilet freshener just because you think there is a smell to this society. Why not?

Champagne in the Morning is a figure of speech, a lifestyle. Part ‘Rock’ n Roll, non-conformism, art and part fuck you!

In love with elegance and overflowing with imagination, the designer decided to launch her Bain de Nuit brand in 1998 with the help of her son John.

Every single processed diamond that adorns a piece of Charlotte Grace  jewelry is certified as ""conflict free"" by the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS).

""La Fermeture Éclair” is a fully functional zipper as a bracelet that is durable, made of  precious gold and customizable with precious stones.

ChaYkra,"['Womenswear', 'Sportswear']","BRAND: ChaYkra DESCRIPTION: Our differing backgrounds and complementary knowledge sets inspired us to launch this entrepreneurial venture. Since we both have experience of high-pressure corporate jobs, we recognise the importance of lifestyle balance and investing in 'de-stress' time through activities like meditation and yoga.
We had a vision of creating a yoga clothing brand combining comfort and style, whilst paying homage to yoga’s Indian roots and our heritage. chaYkra reflects our ‘Brindian’ identity, infusing classic British elegance with Indian vibrancy and colour. All our clothes are made from breathable fabric and are super soft & comfy to help you relax and have a truly energising yoga practise! We decided on our brand name in honour of the sanskrit word 'chakra' which relates to the spinning wheels of energy within the body. The seven letters reflect the seven chakras of the body. We added a 'Y' to balance out the word, a dual symbol for both 'yoga' and 'you'. Yoga balances chakra energy flows and gives valuable time for self-reflection.
Yoga is derived from the Sanskrit work ‘yug’, meaning ‘to join together.’ This principle is one of the key anchor values of our brand. Everyone involved in our production process is important to us and we want consumers to feel a connection with the source of their garments. In fact, a key motivation behind the brand’s creation was our desire to help the Indian community. We are committed to the principles of fair trade and have gone to great lengths to ensure the materials and factories we use uphold the highest of ethical standards. We hope our brand values resonate with others. When you choose to wear chaYkra clothes you are making a choice for sustainable, high quality and stylish yoga-wear.

Our friendly team are available to help with any enquiries you may have.

This “flight” worn by American aviation pilots in the 1950s. Beautiful, comfortable, solid. Like this other jacket, which bore the name of a Frenchman: Charles CHEVIGNON ... Its creator, Guy Azoulay, carried by his dream of America, claims a style and inspirations mostly made in the USA. Keen on second-hand clothes, he then brought together iconic pieces from the American army, before reinventing them in what would constitute his first collection. This reinterpretation of pieces found in the four corners of the world will become his trademark. Very quickly, the CHEVIGNON phenomenon imposed itself. An urban, elegant and adventurous wardrobe. Timeless. Twistant allure casually. Brilliant sober. Wholesale:

Over two decades ago we made our first Chrome bag with a Juki sewing machine, a few yards of industrial-grade nylon, military grade truck tarpaulin, and the commitment to making durable useful gear that works on and off the bike. We didn’t have money to make a buckle that could hold the weight of a loaded messenger bag, so we salvaged seatbelt buckles out of junkyard cars. An icon was born. Our original messenger bag with its seatbelt buckle quickly became a favorite of professional messengers around the world. More importantly, our way of making things was defined. We call it Freedom through limitations. URBAN UTILITY™
People don’t need more stuff, they need better stuff that use less resources. More function, less fashion. We design and build our own things and care about how stuff is made. Everything we make is purpose built. Street-tested by our own crew and professionals around the world. If it doesn't have a purpose, it's gone. Over the last 20 years we never wavered from our commitment to making useful durable gear for people who live and ride in the city.

LIVE THE CITY
Beyond the products we make, Chrome is a way of living the city. It's working hard, playing hard and riding hard. Living at the intersection of creativity, resourcefulness, community and grit. Where art, music, photography, bike, moto, and skate collide. It’s protecting our playground and making our cities even more rad places to be.

Clairval,['Womenswear'],"BRAND: Clairval DESCRIPTION: Clairval was founded in 1959 in the city of Lucerne, by the sisters Claire and Valerie Pinçon. Finding no outfit to their liking in the still very masculine world of alpine skiing, they decided to create their own wardrobe in a pop and colorful spirit.

What started out as a personal adventure began to inspire the women around them. They thus allowed, without knowing it, a whole generation to acquire the confidence and the equipment necessary for the practice of Alpine skiing.

Gradually the brand was forgotten, until an industrialist, on one of her many trips around the world, was intrigued by the discovery of an orange ski jacket.

After meticulous research, she was finally able to recover some archives of this enchanted past. She immediately identified with the two sisters. She herself had to struggle all her life against the pre-established codes.

Back from the trip, her obsession with Claire and Valerie's story continued to grow.

She created a wardrobe inspired by the archives she had been able to find.

Just two seasons after the rebirth of Clairval, the brand is already distributed in many boutiques around the world.

From the very beginning we've always thought differently. And done things differently too. From the slipper created by Cyrus and James Clark back in 1825 to the world's first foot shaped shoe; from our kids' ranges in whole sizes, half sizes and a choice of widths to our state-of-the-art iPad foot gauge; from innovative underfoot cushioning to rapid prototyping and 3D printing, brilliant ideas are what set us apart.

Classyandfabulous Jewelry,['Accessories'],"BRAND: Classyandfabulous Jewelry DESCRIPTION: Welcome to CLASSYANDFABULOUS JEWELRY 

I am glad to welcome you on my site. My name is Lucie Daskiewitsch, I am 33 years old and live with my 3 children in Berlin. On this site, I would like to tell you about my way into the world of jewelry designers and explain why a quote changed my whole life.

For years, I wore flashy jewelry. It had to be lots, large and loud - that's what I was known for. On my arms always a bunch of bracelets and wrist bands - nobody knew me without, it belonged to me and became my trademark.

Until one day I had no idea anymore what to do with it. Suddenly, it became quite around me - around my arms, my ears, my fingers and my neck. I didn't feel like anything, everything was too much, too colorful, the choice too big, the quality often not good.

Then I decided to leave the drawers closed, to remove everything, not to wear anything anymore but my watch and small earrings, maybe a small bracelet here and a tiny ring there. Not too much, I wanted to be 'silent', not strike with my jewelry - and I liked it... I liked it so much that I started looking for this silent, tiny, noble, very special ornaments that I liked so much. Filigree and fairytale-like that's what they should be, chic and elegant. I remembered a nice quote from Coco Channel which should changed my life from now on: 'A girl should be two things: classy and fabulous'.

Yes, so it was that my taste and style changed - all of a sudden, from today to tomorrow - from completely 'overdressed' to somehow 'less is more', maybe just more to 'being a grown up'!

From that moment on, I looked intensively for jewelry that suit me. There were a lot of beautiful things but either the quality did not fit (I just wanted precious metals, genuine jewelry, no costume jewelry - something for my whole life, not only for one season - something classy, timeless) - or it was incredibly expensive. 

So everything what I could imagine to wear was against my quality standards or prize expectation!!!

Freely, according to the formula: Jewelry, that I buy as a woman must be payable, I started to make my own designs.

Things I loved assisted as inspiration. BEADS, PRECIOUS METALS and a loooot of GLITTER. It should become MY jewelry and that's how I started designing and producing. I wanted something that I didn't find before - good quality, modest design but still special.

Very quickly, this project became my passion, my environment liked it and the demand was high. Day and night, I was full of joy when I could realize my ideas and my collection grew bigger and bigger. But selling? I did not dare, I was not sure if it would last, how was the quality of my products, the consistency - after all I hand made everything myself out of materials that I did not really know before.

So I tested a lot, carried my products day and night 365 days a year to be able to guarantee durability and quality standards. Now, after almost 3 years I am doing my craft with passion and commitment. 

Today, CLASSYANDFABULOUS JEWELRY stands for payable, elegant and timeless ornaments, made of high-quality materials which are hand made affectionately. The jewelry shall underline the personal look of its wearer, inspire and allow to change it according to desire, mood and outfit.

Every product is an exiting trip for me, unique and unmistakable through the very expressive beads and their simply persuasive style.

Here as well, I cite Coco Chanel with pleasure once again : 'Simplicity is the keynote of all true elegance.'

Fashion & Fun

Functionality of a Claudio Ferrici bag of wallet is always the most important thing, however we also believe every item should have a hint of fashion and a splash of fun.
This makes every style a contemporary product which you can enjoy for a long time!

Character comes with age

Leather is a natural product, which ages when used. Like with people, signs of time give a bag its unique character, each wrinkle and each scar tells you a story!
Like skin, leather needs moisturizing from time to time, this keeps it in shape and looking beautiful. Our Clean & care spray can give your bag what it needs. Use it wisely and always test it on an less visible part of the bag first.
It is important you never use other products like repellent spray, shoe cream of suede spray on our leather as this might damage it. This damage is mostly irreversible and use of wrong products will end our warranty.

CMEO COLLECTIVE,"['Menswear', 'Womenswear']","BRAND: CMEO COLLECTIVE DESCRIPTION: STORY

Since establishment in 2010, C/MEO has endeavoured to build its own signature aesthetic through inspired use of directional prints, premium fabrics and strong silhouettes. Apart, each piece created is wearable innovation; together, a formidable collection of sartorial strength, always championing beauty and form through directional design.
C/MEO's consistent innovation and boundary pushing cements their position as an authority in the Australian and global fashion scene.
A C/MEO woman interprets the garments in her own way, which is an empowering motive for the design team to consistently strive for new heights.

The C/MEO girl is culturally engaged and ahead of the pack.  You'll find her at the latest exhibition or opening of a new bar you'd never heard of until now.
She is a risk taker but not reckless when it comes to fashion. Empowered by her choices, she is a leader and a source of inspiration for her friends.
Her style is authentic and always true to her tastes; she knows what she likes, what she wants and how to make it her own. 

Each of C/MEO’s eleven yearly collections hinges from a central theme, which inspires the fundamental prints, shapes and fabric. Therefore, each C/MEO range can be seen as a capsule collection, where one range can stand independently from the others. Together, they form a formidable collage of wearable innovation. In this respect, C/MEO are truly innovative, as the process behind their creation runs deeper than just clean lines and following trends.

Coach,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Bags', 'Footwear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Coach DESCRIPTION: Coach is a global fashion house founded in New York in 1941. Inspired by the vision of Creative Director Stuart Vevers and the inclusive and courageous spirit of our hometown, we make beautiful things, crafted to last—for you to be yourself in. Coach began with a dream to hand-craft leather into beautiful, clever, practical things. Founded in New York in 1941 by six artisans, the house grew under the vision of Lillian and Miles Cahn to become the Original American House of Leather.

Then came Bonnie Cashin: hired by Miles Cahn in 1962 to be Coach’s first lead designer. With Bonnie’s fearless vision of color, proportion and quirk—and her love of doing—Coach transformed into the perfect reflection of modern freedom and equality, the attitude of 60s New York.

In the decades that followed, Coach opened its first store on Madison Avenue and transformed from a family-run leathergoods company into a fashion house known around the world for its distinct attitude and lifestyle collections inspired by New York.

Today, as in 1941, we are shaped by our unique story—and committed, in everything we do, to celebrating craft, our hometown and the optimism of authentic American style.

COFUR DENMARK,['Womenswear'],"BRAND: COFUR DENMARK DESCRIPTION: COFUR Denmark was founded in the year 2013 by the travel-loving couple: Gitte and Kim Henriksen, who, through several trips and one longer stay abroad, fell in love with the old silk sarees from India. A sari an approximately 6 meters long piece of fabric that can be draped around the body and fastened with a safety measure. Sarees are a way in which Indian women express themselves and are associated, in addition to femininity, also with grace, beauty, and elegance. In addition to their great fondness for Indian fabrics, we do not escape the fact that the fashion industry is one of the biggest culprits from an environmental perspective. And that is why, at COFUR Denmark, we have done away with toxic chemicals, textile dyeing, and other disturbing processes that are associated with “fast fashion” trends. For what is more sustainable than buying up existing silk that is already in circulation, getting it checked, washed, and sewn on to other styles? We can hardly think of anything else…

But just because the saree is already in circulation, it must also live up to our high standards in terms of quality, colors, and prints. Therefore, the selection of the right saris takes place via a digital connection between Denmark and India, when we can not physically visit our Indian colleagues. The selection is an important process, whereby the sarees are neatly hand-picked, so we can always guarantee you the perfect combination of colors and prints. Subsequently, the saris are washed and get into the hands of well-trained seamstresses, who have given new life to the old saris. That way you have the opportunity to continue a lifelong story - from woman to woman with love!

Colchester Rubber Co.,['Footwear'],"BRAND: Colchester Rubber Co. DESCRIPTION: The World's Oldest Basketball Sneaker
The Colchester Rubber Co. Basketball Sneaker is an important part of our American Heritage history. The impeccable quality and detail to design showcase the Victorian's talent and pride in their work. The original sneaker's rubber has yellowed with age. Originally it was white. The rubber is impure and you can see bits and particles in the outer and bottom sole because they had not yet invented a way to remove impurities, that invention did not occur until around 1913, and at that time it was also figured out how to make rubber in different colors. 

Hemp deadgrass colored fabric, tin metal eyelets, brown ribbed toe caps and intricate white stitching. The original laces, as pictured here, are stained with age and use. 

The Owner of Colchester Rubber Co., George Watkinson, was from England and many of their designs were inspired from his home country.

The sneakers are believed to have once been owned and worn by Dr. James Naismith, inventor of Basketball. He invented the game in 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts, a mere 50 miles away from Colchester Rubber Co's factory. The sneakers were most likely a prototype designed for Dr. Naismith by Colchester Rubber to be used in his new game of basket-ball. 

The Colchester Rubber Co. Basketball Sneaker predates any of it's competitors by a quarter of a century, making it the world's oldest basketball sneaker.

Colchik,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Kidswear']","BRAND: Colchik DESCRIPTION: Laura Moustacakis, a French-German designer, founded Colchik in 2016. From the beginning she concieved it as a family business, just at the border between life and work. Because it is the only way she can imagine her life: as a whole. Colchik naturally puts family in the center of its project. Have you ever noticed how happy it makes a child to wear the same garment as his mother or father? We believe a family wardrobe contributes to deep family connections, creating common values and tastes. We believe in the magical power of clothes and that they are a strong sentimental link between people. For years, our Colchik family was on the move. Originally from Paris, we spent long time in the Middle East and in the South of France. Then for two years, we roamed the world, travelling from France to China and back again in a van. One day, it was time to settle down. We chose Potsdam, on the outskirts of Berlin, for both its vibrant culture and vast nature. Now we work as local as possible. The designs, patterns and prototypes are made by hand in our Potsdam workshop. The garments are produced in a mid-sized company in Poland, not far from Berlin, so we can keep everything close at hand.

After years in the world of ready-to-wear and at the head of several high-end multi-brand shops, they go round in circles and are no longer in the offer of the moment. Thanks to their many trips to Indonesia, they decide to go to Bali where inspiration is there. Thus, in 2008 they launched their first capsule collections in their Cannes shop.

From 2015, the collections are growing to be present today in more than a hundred points of sale in France, abroad and always, in their historic shop in Cannes. All our pieces are handmade in Bali. Our prints are designed and exclusively created for genesis. Today, about sixty people work all year round on the collections under the watchful eye of Ayu, our workshop manager.

The brand has further explored research both in increasingly technical and performing fabrics to help the sporting performance and in the world of fashion. 

Important collaborations have started with companies such as Directa Plus, which produces Graphene (Colmar was the first company to apply it on a fabric) and with designers of international fame: capsule collections with Au Jour le Jour, Shayne Oliver and White Mountaineering.

The company is still a “family business” and is run by the third generation, the grandsons of the founder, Mario, Giulio and Carlo, and it still has strong bonds in the Monza area.

Born and raised in Amsterdam we hunt in pairs, we seek the best and enjoy the utmost. We strive to find co-rebels. We are always on the move. We drink, party and love like there is no tomorrow.
We are young. We are restless.
Colourful Rebel is more than just fashion. More than just a blog. Colourful Rebel is a mentality, a way of life, we like to get the most out of life, but we are just as happy to give back to those around us. Our journey started in a student apartment in the west of Amsterdam. This is where we transformed our apartment into a small warehouse. and then you guys discovered Colourful Rebel and liked it…
We had the chance to move into a bigger apartment. The ground floor became our warehouse where we packed all the orders and the first floor was our office. We grew so fast that within a year we outgrew this apartment as well and moved to our office in the city center.
We rented two floors and within little over one year this office also became way too small. Samples, stock and other random stuff filled our office and it was time to move on.
We were offered our current and put our heart and soul into the renovation, and after blood, sweat and tears we feel that our office turned out perfect!
Food is very important to us so we had to have a cozy kitchen we could hang out in. After lunch dips were an unavoidable consequence so we had to have a super relaxed living room. And to get rid of all the work stress we installed a pool table, a Playstation, a table tennis table, a dartboard and a boxing bag.
Our office truly reflects who we are: perfectionists, rebels and caregivers. We enjoy the good things in life, we love to hang out with our friends and take care of them.

Costo,['Accessories'],"BRAND: Costo DESCRIPTION: Costo is a creation of three Finnish designers combining their visions and skills to make something new and unprecedented in the field of design. We started in 2006, in a basement room, with lots of passion, but not much money to mention. Previously we had studied fashion, design and handicrafts. With nothing much to create from, we started to buy industrial leftover materials to ease our appetite for creating environmentally sustainable and good-looking designs. The concept proved worthy, and we started retailing and opened our own webstore in 2008. Today, after 10-years in business, the first Costo Concept Store was opened at Yrjönkatu 34, Helsinki Finland. Costo products combine three important aspects: quality, ecology and style. All of them have to be of the best caliber. Our demands are based on proper skills in handicrafts, that being the whole basis of our design. This knowledge enables us to master the whole production process so that the quality of production is always in control. Using the leftover materials we make sure our products do not add up to deplete natural resources. Inspired by our adventures to Papua during 2007, we have named all our products after Papuan islands, tribes & towns.

We strive to make timeless products that stay fashionable regardless the period in question. As well as we do not pigeonhole time into narrow trends and seasons, we also do not segment people into narrow genres and age groups. It goes against the prevailing throw-away-mentality, where things are made only for a moment´s pleasure. Costo is not a servant to any genre or time. We strive for style without borders. For us at Costo, style, ecology and lasting quality go hand in hand.

Each item is designed and created by Raphaëlle Cavalli and her integrated design studio.

Cotélac is also well-known for its partnerships and artistic commitment, in particular, with emerging creative talents. Each season, Cotélac supports musicians in their artistic development.

Cotélac workshops are well established in France where fabrics are pleated and printed on one by one with all the care and attention they deserve. Although creative with a French stylistic inspiration, Cotélac has proven open mindedness to foreign cultures : a real travelling textile laboratory enables finding the best know-how beyond its territory.

Coton Doux,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Kidswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Coton Doux DESCRIPTION: Early 1988, Hassan, still a young student in business studies, was working every week end on a project in the world of art with his brother Kamel Mennour (founder of the Kamel Mennour Art Galerie). During this time he started his initiation to the World of Contemporary Art. 

During this period, Hassan spent the majority of his time traveling, and visiting art centers, contemporary art fairs, art galleries, exhibitions both local and regional in order to enrich and enlarge his visual capacities. 

Very soon his love for fashion helped an idea sprout in his mind: mixing fashion and art. He immediately decided to try to create a line of shirt for men and women with audacious and at this time unique colors. 

In 1994 “Citron Doux” was born. It was quickly renamed “Coton Doux”. Many collections followed, constantly renewed, inspired by places of Contemporary Art (Art Basel, Fiac, Frieze, Tokyo Palace,…). Thorough out all those years a friendship was created with certain artists. These same artists offered their ideas and their art to help him with his new creation and to show him their support. 

In 1998, an encounter with Olivier Pacaud, now a colleague opened up a path for exporting his products. Later one with Suzanne Sarrandon (Thelmaet Louise) as well as one with an editor of the lifestyle magazine called “InStyle” (USA), who litteraly fell in love with his fabrics and boxer shorts boosted the company. 

Later in the year 2000, Ramzy joined the team, therefore reinforcing logistics already in place and optimizing this rigorous process. 

Coton Doux’s success was growing and Coton Doux built up a team of freelance graphic, photographic and design artists as well as a team of dynamic and enthusiastic young adults who helped reactivate and improve his creations as well as the brand’s reactivity. 

Coton Doux's success is almost entirely based on the quality of the fabric, on the fabric’s originality, its subtle creations and the perfect presentation of the products each separately arranged in matching bags.

Crew Clothing Company,"['Accessories', 'Footwear', 'Kidswear', 'Menswear', 'Swimwear', 'Womenswear']","BRAND: Crew Clothing Company DESCRIPTION: Every story starts with an idea. Ours was simple: to create timeless clothes inspired by the British coast. With its cobbled streets, crystal clear water and unbeatable views, Salcombe was the perfect inspiration for professional skier, Alastair Parker-Swift’s first menswear collection. When he wasn’t competing for England, Alistair ran a successful windsurfing school. It was here that Crew Clothing was born.

Alistair’s first collection consisted of the rugby shirt, detailed with our iconic ’93 patch. He took it from Salcombe to Cowes Week to the King’s Road. 79 stores later and the rest is history. Nothing feels better than finding something that just works.

Everything we design is made to be worn from week-to-weekend so whether you’re putting an outfit together for brunch with friends or that important date in your diary, we’ve got the pieces you need.

Start with the basics and everything else will fall into place.

We believe only the best will do.

That’s why we always design using top quality fabrics that have been specially finished for the softest possible feel.

From seam to seam, pin-sharp attention to detail ensures that every piece is a cut above. Undercollar embroidery, contrast cuffs, internal ribbon appliqué… it’s the hidden touches that make Crew special.

Cruyff began a collaboration in 1982 with Emidio Lazzarini, the Italian designer who first introduced functionality and elegance into the world of sportswear. Today, Cruyff is a sports lifestyle brand and the originator of Football Luxury. Cruyff creates high quality, fashionable shoes and clothing with a luxurious look that makes you feel like you’re always ‘one ahead’.

Cup of Joe Denim,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear']","BRAND: Cup of Joe Denim DESCRIPTION: Why would a denim brand call itself “Cup of Joe”?

One day, the navy secretary Josephus Daniels decided to resolve the mess on his ships by claiming: “Any mind bender habits that would distract the navy from performing their main tasks will be banned”. That day, along with many others, alcohol was banned from the fleet. Thus the cups started to fill with coffee, and the fleet sobered. Coffee then acquired a new name, “Cup of Joe”. We think that today’ denim world is quite messy with confusing claims and the extravagant market prices. We then decided to fill our cups with coffee, just to make the lives simpler for all of us. Would you care for one? “Vintage Denim Redesigned”

Denim does not age; it only evolves with time. It carries the marks of our footsteps and the spirit of every moment. When the time comes, it is redesigned by the experts. Over the years, it has reborn, and we have witnessed the evolution of the vintage denim. Today, we complement yesterday with just a touch of modern trends: we redesign the vintage denim.

At home, these are all the places that are special for us. Who give us strength and touch our soul.
The forest path that we have walked so many times. The view of the city skyline, into which we are always drawn.
The walk on the beach, barefoot in the first light of the day. There are so many places at home. In the mountains. At the lake. In the clearing. In the streets of the city.
At home is far from civilization in the hut as well as in the morning crowd of rush hour.

At home is wherever we have roots. At home is the place we share with loved ones.
And that we like to tell others about. At home are the little things that make our lives so valuable.
At home is where we close our eyes and know: Here I want to be.

With our DAHEIM collection, we want to bring this feeling to you.
Textiles, jewelry, accessories and beautiful things for home & living: things for everyday life that accompany you.
No matter where you are. A piece of home is always with you.

It was here that businessman Peder Jebsen was in transit in 1872. But where others saw beautiful waterfalls and sheep grazing, Jebsen saw rich access to hydropower and wool. He founded Dale Fabrikker in 1879, later renamed Dale of Norway. With extensive experience in the textile industry, Jebsen secured the rights to the local hydropower. Shortly afterwards, steamboats arrived from England with production equipment. Since then, we have had continuous production at Dale. We grew rapidly and became the largest employer in the area. The children often accompanied the parents to the work, and in this way experiences and expertise were passed on to the next generation.

Over the years, we have continuously adjusted and improved our production. Many of our employees have worked in the factory most of their adult lives, such as family members before them.

Since we are one of very few textile companies that still have production in Norway, we can follow the production process closely, and thus ensure first-class quality on each individual garment.

Dancing Leopard,['Womenswear'],"BRAND: Dancing Leopard DESCRIPTION: It all started in 2009, when our founders, Jade and Jack, embarked on an adventure to explore India. Inspired by Goa’s vibrant fabric markets, they began sourcing material to create clothing that fused confident colours with powerful prints. Just like that, Dancing Leopard was born.

First, the brand caused a stir in London, before heading to Ibiza to make a feline-shaped mark on the island’s best-loved boutiques. Here, Dancing Leopard quickly became known for its bold designs and bohemian spirit. As the buzz around them grew, Jade and Jack began introducing new standout styles; delivering collections that spoke to the individual and celebrated the untamed. We’ve come a long way since then (think an international website, concessions in ten countries and a team of over 20) but we’ve always stayed true to who we are. Taking influence from our Indian and Balearic roots, we believe in clothing that empowers and inspires. It’s been a wild ride, and the best is yet to come.

Our Mission

We empower people to live life fiercely, no matter who they are, or where they’re from.  Creating statement clothing with an adventurous side, our styles work from island to city life. We clash our prints and go bold with colour; dropping unique designs that encourage confidence and celebrate self-expression.

The Earth is our home and we take our commitment to it seriously. That’s why we started a sustainable swimwear line made from repurposed ocean waste. Our future intentions are to re-think fabric across our entire collection for eco-friendly fashion that puts the planet first.

Danefæ was founded when 4 childhood friends got tired of the bike ride to work with a raincoat that was far more practical than beautiful. Danefae's mission was clear from the start:
We wanted to make quality products, pay homage to Scandinavian design history and add some color to daily life around town. We wanted to ""Make practical beautiful"", and to embrace the whimsical Nordic weather patterns with colorful and functional designs.

Since then, the collections have grown larger and larger, but we still have the same mission.

Our outerwear is designed according to skiwear principles with technical membrane systems and taped seams that keep wind and rain out, but allow your body to breathe.

In parallel, our outerwear is designed for a city, country, forest, mountain, or beach life guided by our love of fresh air, simplicity, style, mobility and a vivid color palette.

We always consider production and consumption carefully. We believe in sustainability through a confrontation of the disposable ""fast fashion"" culture. Danefae outerwear is built for the long haul.

We work with manufacturers that are all BSCI certified and in addition either Oeko-tex, Swan label, or GOTS certified. Our colorful and durable products, in addition to current European and Danish legislation, follow a very special Danefæ regulatory framework for the use of chemistry, ensuring durability and guaranteeing beauty even after many years of use.

Our wind and waterproof outerwear is designed and manufactured without fluorocarbons.

All weather is good weather when you have Danefæ on!

Deadwood,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Deadwood DESCRIPTION: Deadwood was founded in 2012 by Carl Ollson and Felix von Bahder. The two buddies had gotten to know each other working in a jeans shop together in Stockholm but they would soon begin dreaming of creating a store concept of their own, one that truly embodied their personalities and aesthetics. Said and done, the dream came true and soon they had opened their very own boutique. It was going to be vintage store, a treasure chest for used pre-loved clothes, but it would go on and become so much more. Slowly the idea of a clothing line evolved, and more so – a new way of doing things differently. The production of clothing, today a trillion dollar industry, is one of the dirtiest in the world. It was clear that this fashion status quo needed to be turned on it's head. Carl and Felix had the perfect platform to rise to the task. Deadwood, as a clothing brand, was born. We strive for sustainability in everything we do. Whether we can achieve it is another matter but it’s certainly a guiding star. For us that means making use of materials that otherwise would have gone to waste. Of course, durability is also a big concern, we need to create garments that will stand the test of time and garments that when they finally wear out actually deserve repairing. But sustainability also means trying to create timeless designs that age well.

De Bonne Facture,"['Menswear', 'Accessories', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: De Bonne Facture DESCRIPTION: « de bonne facture » is a French expression describing a way of doing things well. It is a word that can be used for a poem, a piece of furniture, a piece of clothing. It is a way of saying that designing is inseparable from manufacturing, and that a certain form of integrity can be respected in the way clothes are made today. I have always been inspired by the classic menswear wardrobe, its fabrics and its craftsmanship. Shetland wool jumpers, cotton poplin shirts, oversized raincoats with careful details… Clothes that are worn out by time have always charmed me, their irregularities and their marks of use give them soul. I love when these quality clothes are worn with a form of casualness, and I often watch people in Paris carry themselves with this slightly informal touch that is also beautiful when worn by women.

I imagined a wardrobe that brings back memories while always feeling up to date. A label with simple lines and quality materials that last. Clothes that can be put on, used, infused with movements, personal stories, while connecting them to the ateliers that have made them, to the hands that have assembled them.

Clothing is closely linked to nature, to agriculture where the fibers stem from: the cotton and linen flowers, the thistles that were used to brush flannels, the wool from the sheep shorn by farmers. Some textile regions keep cultures of craftsmanship alive. They are often linked to their landscapes and the activities of their inhabitants, like wool in Brittany, close to the ocean, or wool and leather in the Tarn, in the Midi-Pyrenean. Paying a tribute to these local cultures of craftsmanship, highlighting « made by » without being limited to a country, is central to my philosophy.

De La Vali,['Womenswear'],"BRAND: De La Vali DESCRIPTION: Ibizan raised life-long friends Jana Haveman and Laura Castro founded womenswear RTW label, De La Vali in 2017. Upon first meeting the pair recognised an instant connection both personally and creatively as they began designing small collections inspired by an awareness and shared appreciation for the bohemian culture and captivating surrounding’s they grew up in. De La Vali was initially created when the duo noticed a gap in the market for luxe, statement pieces that could transcend from beach to bar and party, with versatility at the core of each striking wardrobe stand out. Each DLV piece owns an alluring quality with considerations of spontaneity and the ‘free-spirited’ Island life of which the brand heritage is best known for at the forefront of every design. The founders natural shared vision and aesthetic runs throughout the design process, resulting in a joyous partnership. Jana initially sketches the dresses and together they embark on the process of developing each concept and building the collection.

Now overseeing a small in house team and one or two valued freelancers the Vali family is slowly expanding. Each signature DLV print is lovingly developed in house and always in limited edition. The aim was to create an inclusive brand for all women to enjoy but still offering exclusive product, not overproduced or oversupplied.

DLV celebrates femininity, always paying special attention to the cut and silhouette of each style to ensure confidence while flattering the female shape. Each sample is meticulously fitted, cut and progressed in house by our treasured freelance pattern cutters.

The brand is now as deep rooted in its London base as much as it’s Ibizan heritage,

“our team are situated here – we have grown a small community of ‘like minded’ creatives on our doorstep and it works really well, even in the initial stages of starting the brand we knew that in order to evolve Vali into a credible and successful label we would need to relocate to the iconic city that had so greatly inspired our design aesthetic.” 

 But why the name, DE LA VALI? the brand is an ode to their muse, ""Vali Myers"" a visionary artist, dancer and bohemian whose extroverted and vivacious way of being captivated all who she encountered. She was bold, unapologetic and unashamedly expressive of who she was. Vali remains a positive role model that greatly inspires each and every DLV collection. Still tightly woven throughout the brand DNA is a simple but strong mission, to create styles that encourage you to feel confident, vivacious and empowered.

With this initial thought DePalma Workwear was founded in 2016, driven by Jonas Skommevik and Thomas Flinn. They noticed a new generation of craftsmen, ranging from carpenters to restaurant workers and mechanics, ready to leave old ways and stereotypes behind. It was time to breathe fresh air into a conservative market. With decades of experience creating and developing international fashion and streetstyle brands from Sweden, the idea of bringing a bit of lifestyle into workwear sounded just about right. From their head office in Stockholm the DePalma team of professionals design, sell and market workwear for a new generation of craftsmen. The initial thought has an answer; DePalma is remodelling the workwear industry.

Back then, when the Hanseatic Thomas Köhlert listened to the four fives, he had found it:

Derbe, the word that perfectly combines the cool side of its hometown with the charm of the stiff breeze. The first collection was designed together with Sandy Baumgarten as a designer and has always worked together.

Our expertise in northern German weather and cool design can be seen in both the functional jackets with an urban style and the iconic shirts.

Celebrating the moment and life without taking yourself too seriously is a mission of our street fashion. Convincing handling of adverse weather conditions paired with urban design are characteristic of our functional clothing.

Making the world more beautiful is not enough for us, we want our globe to be happier and fairer. The animal welfare organization Peta has certified us. We make animal-free fashion from 100% sustainable materials.

So of course we stay true to ourselves as a brand, but we like to develop further in terms of material responsibility and sustainability. Wholesale

Spanish graphic designer, illustrator and sculptor, Peret, sketched our first logo: the Humans (a woman and a man holding hands... naked). And architect Tonet Sunyer designed the first Desigual store in Ibiza’s port in 1986. Those years served as a meeting point for many people who were fascinated by this free, authentic, optimistic, unapologetic and Mediterranean universe which, from Barcelona, continues to inspire the world more than three decades later.

Destin,['Accessories'],"BRAND: Destin DESCRIPTION: It was 2008. I had just finished developing my idea of large scarves made from precious and lightweight weaves, with a distressed design and extreme finish. In other words, the complete opposite of classic style, completely innovative compared to the products on the market. Following my intuition, I produced a few scarves and decided to ship them to my dear friend in Tokyo, Yashiki Hideharu, who is a fashion scouter and distributor in Japan. I handed them over to the courier, and that was the last I thought about them. It was time to go on holiday. I left for Florida. At Fort Lauderdale I hired a Harley Davidson Road King and headed helmetless for the road; only in America. It was the 20th of August. There were vast open roads, endless horizons and lots to think about. My phone rang. It was an enthusiastic Yashiki, telling me that my scarves were perfect for a mature yet demanding market such as Japan. “They are really special, they are something that nobody has thought of yet.” To talk to him I stopped the bike in a clearing on the Interstate 98, which was heading towards Pensacola. Yashiki started to press me: “They need a name, we must find a brand name!” I wasn’t prepared, I hadn’t even thought about it; I knew everything about the production, but when it came to all the rest I was floored. Suddenly I looked around. In front of me was a sign that read “Destin, the World’s Luckiest Fishing Village”. What a stroke of luck! “Destin,” I said to Yashiki in disbelief, “the brand is Destin.” And that was how the adventure began.

DEVERNOIS,"['Womenswear', 'Footwear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: DEVERNOIS DESCRIPTION: DEVERNOIS is beyond all else a great team of workers: men and women who are passionate about their job, devoted to designing and breathing life into subtle collections that combine elegance, creativity and know-how. Each piece starts with a sketch drawn in our workshop in Roanne, guided by a memory, a form of inspiration, an increasingly powerful desire to create clothing that helps women feel beautiful.

Known by all thanks to its famous slogan: ""En DEVERNOIS je suis moi (DEVERNOIS makes me feel like myself)"" , the brand was founded in the 1930s by my grand-father, Claudius Devernois.

DEVERNOIS is lucky enough to have a strong historical background: my grand-father began his professional career in 1920.

With his head filled with dreams and his simple, generous personality, this bold entrepreneur pioneered his way into the textile industry. With Roanne and its surroundings being a stronghold for weaving, he banked on knitting when founding his very first workshop.

He thus created his first brand, SIONREVED (an anagram for DEVERNOIS), specialised in Jacquard-woven clothing for men. He had fun posing as a model for his own creations in the catalogues he sent out!

Cool curvy fashionistas stand by their figure, and therefore want gorgeous and curvy fashion.

DFNS,['Accessories'],"BRAND: DFNS DESCRIPTION: Born to support and accelerate sustainability in a high-polluting fashion and footwear industry; DFNS want to drive change by enabling and inspiring sustainable behavior, empowering athletes, fans and communities alike to take responsibility for their carbon footprint.
 
Choosing gear that is durable, timeless in its design, and made from recycled and/ or recyclable fibers is a great place to start. But the way gear is taken care of once it leaves the shop makes considerable difference, not only to the planet, but the performance of your product too.
 
DFNS is the missing CARE link, existing between the moment you buy your gear and the moment you dispose of it responsibly. At DFNS, our products are powered by air using Airopack®—innovative technology that’s safer for you and the planet. A traditional aerosol uses pressurized gas to propel its contents, releasing harmful solvents at the same time. Airopack® uses compressed air instead of volatile chemicals, so when you spray, all you get is the actual product and nothing more. Thanks to the Pressure Control Device—a handy lil mechanism that guarantees a consistent spray ‘til the bitter end, you’ll use a massive 98% of your product. Plus, there are no surprises. The transparent Airopack® bottle lets you see exactly how much you’ve got left.
 
All our solutions are water-based, solvent-free and biodegradable. Footwear Refresher, Footwear Cleaner and Cleaning Wipes are produced in a Cradle to Cradle Gold certified factory—one of only a handful in the world. Footwear Protector is made in a factory with an NSF certification, which is a food-grade safety certification. Our suppliers also continually strive to reduce water usage, waste and their CO2 impact. Our Apparel Launder and Denim Launder are manufactured in a facility that abides by the AISE charter, a voluntary EU initiative that promotes and facilitates a common industry approach to safety and sustainability.

Didi,['Womenswear'],"BRAND: Didi DESCRIPTION: DIDI is a Dutch online fashion brand with Indian roots. Established in the 80’s and offers a collection that makes you look special. The brand is known for her trendy and female designs with unique prints and modern elements.

In 2021 DIDI has been re-launched, as a more sustainable online-only brand. We continued to build on what DIDI stands for: comfortable fittings, soft and natural materials, and unique prints. DIDI rediscovered the collaboration with manufacturers who have known the brand for many years. Manufacturers that understand the specs that were successful for DIDI and helps achieve the same quality standards. To innovate we introduced also a new touch. While we work on a new collection, we make conscious choices if an extra detail adds value or if the garment is pretty by itself and does not need more spice. 

What makes DIDI unique? For a big share it’s the craftmanship of the prints. Something that we cherish, every day again. The love and passion of our designers is reflected in the designs. From the first pencil sketch till the final garment. As a fashion brand, DIDI cares for the people and the planet. In production we work with manufacturers who also respect their workers and we are keen on them to treat everyone well. In terms of sustainability, we try to improve ourselves every single day. Although the fashion industry has a long way to go, we want to become better step by step, day by day.  Nowadays, the collections are produced in smaller quantities to avoid overproduction. 90% of our orders are produced nearby to make less impact on the environment. We do select our suppliers based on the sustainable relation from the past, on the quality level and preferably being sustainable, rather than choosing the cheapest one. Our aim is to work with them together for a better product and a better world.

DIDI has chosen to charge the consumer for the shipment of the parcel. By paying the shipment costs, the consumer makes a well- thought decision to buy the product and avoids an impulse buy. In cooperation with our logistic partner, parcels are being shipped CO2-neutral. This does not mean all parcels are delivered by electric cars or by bike, but new trees are planted for the extra duty that we pay. 

DIDI is continuously in development, on each level, on each decision. Soon also in wholesale. We are open to welcome interested retailers and agents.

Renzo intended to reach the entire world since the brand’s very inception, making the word “diesel,” an international term pronounced equally all over the world, the perfect name for his endeavor.
Since its start, Diesel has used “For Successful Living” as a slogan for the brand’s DNA. Through a long and storied history of strong, ironic and playful campaigns, Diesel has become a leader in advertising as well as in fashion. Where the world zigged, Diesel zagged, and in the 35 years since its founding, the brand still embraces the same ethos. Diesel has over 5,000 points of sale worldwide with over 400 monobrand stores, 37 of those in the US. Between 1978 and 2012, the company has produced more than 2,000 different washes of denim.

Dobell,"['Menswear', 'Bodywear', 'Footwear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Dobell DESCRIPTION: Global Tailor Ltd. encompasses a few brands with Dobell and Avail London amongst them synonymous with British heritage and recognized as value and quality offering affordable tailoring for both men and women. Founded in in Great Britain Dobell began with a clear aim: to offer designer British formal wear at a revolutionary price to anyone anywhere.

We were students when one of us was in need of a tuxedo for an upcoming party. The cost of buying one was too high and the idea of renting a tux that had already been worn 100 times didn't appeal. We were amazed at how hard it was to find a nicely fitting suit at a fair price.

Dobell was started to create the solution. Drawing inspiration from the famous tailoring heritage of London we started small and developed a core range of stylish and affordable formal wear made to suit everyone's size shape and wallet. Quickly this sold out and we noticed a number of requests for our products in the U.S. With this our business was born. Dobell USA now offers one of the largest ranges of affordable formal wear in the U.S. whilst retaining the same values and famously British tailoring that the business is built on.

We offer a personalized service to our customers and in our premises you can find the design team creating garments that are manufactured all over the world. Hanging on the rails you will discover beautifully tailored three piece suits ¾ length coats elegantly trimmed and timeless Scottish tweed jackets with details carefully crafted.

How do we do it? By designing in-house being online rather than having fixed physical stores and engaging with customers directly we are able to provide higher quality better looking tailoring at a fraction of the usual price.

We believe that buying a stylish suit should be easy and affordable for everyone. It should leave you looking and feeling good without breaking the bank.

Dockers by Gerli,['Footwear'],"BRAND: Dockers by Gerli DESCRIPTION: t all started in Merzalben, a small town in the middle of the Palatinate Forest and less than ten minutes away from the shoe town of Pirmasens. Gösta Andersson and Bruno Heim, both active in the shoe industry and shoe sales for many years, had recognized the signs of the times: In the mid-80s, everyone wanted dockside shoes, the casual loafers that were traditionally worn on boats. Gerli GmbH decided to take up this trend and designed and produced leather slippers for men for the first time in 1985. The aim was that everyone should be able to afford the “Dockers”, which is why attention was paid to a perfect price-performance ratio right from the start - without neglecting quality. However, the brand was to achieve its breakthrough with another type of shoe: the famous Dockers boots. In light corn yellow or chocolate brown with a high, padded shaft in a mountaineering look, they are iconic to this day. The first Dockers Boots came from factories in Portugal and Spain. The Goodyear Welt design made them particularly robust. The sole is not just glued to the upper, as is conventionally the case, but the sole, frame and upper are sewn together. Today they are reinterpreted almost every year by Dockers designers, with new sole types and details. But their original character has remained and the Dockers Boots are always recognizable as such at first glance.

We therefore do everything we can to support those local heroes from our province and to present a refreshing collection to the Utrecht public that we love so much time and time again. Our collection is broad and mainly consists of items that are perfect for casual occasions. Think of a party at Orloff or a dance at the Sunda festival.

Dunderdon,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Bodywear', 'Footwear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Dunderdon DESCRIPTION: Born in the Swedish port town of Gothenburg in 1997, Dunderdon is Sweden’s most innovative workwear company. Founded by carpenter Per-Ivan Hagberg, the mission at Dunderdon has always been to create clothing for craftsmen who appreciate superior construction and smart design. Per-Ivan’s initial creation was a line of pants made with a uniform fit but designed with different stylistic highlights. The result of this initial solution was clothing that was individualistic and distinct but also clearly part of one related family. By standing up to the demands of a variety of workplaces, early model Dunderdon pants quickly became the standard for Sweden’s many artisans, builders, and craftsmen. Following a successful launch, Per-Ivan went on to design a full collection of clothing for working men and women.
Per-Ivan has always been driven by a vision that there would be no filler designs in the Dunderdon line, that each product would have a reason for being and would satisfy specific needs. This remains a guiding credo today.

From the beginning, whether conceived for a blue-collar professional or a no-collar creative, every article of clothing has been created with a purpose and has seamlessly integrated both form and function.
Today, Dunderdon distributes its wide line of products worldwide and fabricates a full range of pants, outerwear, knits, shirts, and accessories. Every Dunderdon product is tailored to the demands of modern work and incorporates the interconnected concepts of utility, fashion, and style. Dunderdon clothing inspires and enables regardless of demographics. The company continues to produce workwear not bound by trade or environment.

Ultimately, each Dunderdon product must match up with Per-Ivan’s overarching design philosophy: “Honest, simple designs are timeless. Our products should represent the highest craftsmanship and innovation, while never compromising on fit and style. We respect the past, but we don’t rely on it.”

A man from the creative stage, and full of imagination, he opened a discount clothing store and started to design a radically different range. From his very simple desire to create fun and colourful clothes, he raised the curtain on a new world with a strong personality: our first boutique called Du Pareil au même was opened in 1986. The Du Pareil au même brand has been in French children’s wardrobes for more than 30 years. It has revolutionised the market, and today it still champions a new vision of children’s clothing, with its brightly coloured clothes, its unique motifs, its exceptional details and its great quality at a small price!

It's a universal brand: clothes for every occasion, from newborns to tweens, from head to toe.

A happy, playful brand: clothes that mean joy, surprises, bright colours and a sense of humour.

A brand that means freedom : inspired by everything, free of conventions to create original designs; a brand that renews itself and lets everyone put together their own look.
But most of all, a brand that is on the side of children, that adopts their point of view: in sync with their tastes, their desires, their daily life, the things they love and live; a brand that respects their personality, and in which they feel good.

We have a long history at Du Pareil au même: now it’s up to your children to make theirs. Du Pareil au même: what children love.

Eat Dust,"['Accessories', 'Bags', 'Bodywear', 'Footwear', 'Jewelry', 'Menswear', 'Womenswear']","BRAND: Eat Dust DESCRIPTION: Eat Dust is a Belgian denim brand founded in 2010 by longtime friends Rob Harmsen & Keith Hioco in the city of Antwerp. Both were raised on a diet of skateboarding and a healthy dose of punk rock, which instilled a DIY attitude in them.With years of experience in the fashion world – including work for brands as varied as Raf Simons, Essentiel, Diesel, G-Star and Lee – they decided the time was right to venture out on their own.

At the heart of Eat Dust lies Rob & Keith’s headstrong and rebellious nature. They merge classic menswear and their love for denim with a wide range of influences, drawing from old Western styles, military wear, Americana, motorcycling, skateboarding and musical subcultures. Always with an open mind and a need to push forward. The result is a contemporary lifestyle brand with an outspoken attitude.

Eat Dust was founded on the principle of an uncompromising vision and the pursuit of quality, integrity and originality. This includes taking a stand against many of the appalling practices of today’s fashion industry. All production, sourcing and fabric development is retained in Europe, because Eat Dust attaches great importance to craftsmanship, tradition, expertise, human dignity and respect. Plus, proximity makes working together a lot easier.

Eat Dust does things their own way, with conviction and according to principles they determine to be crucial. Staying humble is key, because what’s right for Eat Dust may not be right for everyone else.Eat Dust believes that a responsible and engaged brand is a healthy one, but that doesn’t mean it’s a perfect company. Far from it. But it’s a hell of a good place to start.

He wanted to create a truly sustainable fashion brand and believed the most sustainable thing to do was to stop using natural resources in a careless way to ensure those of the next generation. Since then, Ecoalf’s mission has been to make a new generation of recycled products with the same quality and design as the best non-recycled. For the past 10 years, Ecoalf has become synonymous with its claim BECAUSE THERE IS NO PLANET B®  and developed more than 400 recycled fabrics recycling over 250 million plastic bottles, 80 tonnes of discarded fishing nets, used tires, thousands of tonnes of post-industrial cotton and wool… saving over 63 million liters of water in their last recycled cotton collection.
In 2015, through the Ecoalf Foundation, Ecoalf started Upcycling the Oceans. Born off the coast of Spain, it is a worldwide adventure that is helping to remove marine debris from the bottom of the oceans thanks to the collective effort of more than 3,000 fishermen having recovered more than 700 tonnes of waste. A revolutionary project that has expanded to Thailand, Greece, Italy... and continues to expand throughout the Mediterranean Sea, converting ocean waste into high-quality garments.

EHE Apparel  is not just a brand. EHE Apparel is part of a movement for a better fashion industry  where sustainability and ethical fashion is more important. EHE Apparel was born as an ethical brand which focuses on timeless pieces and everyday  wear. I want to keep EHE Apparel as minimalistic as possible. All our products are made with  ethical production. But what does ethical fashion mean? Ethical fashion is an umbrella term to  
describe ethical fashion design, production, retail and purchasing. It covers a range of issues  such as working conditions, exploitation, fair trade, sustainable production, the environment,  and animal welfare. Ethical fashion also focuses on sustainability and human rights. 
I think honesty, authenticity and being true to yourself are some of the most important values  in today’s society. I’m working with small Budapest based factories, most of which are family  owned, and I have been inside each of them watching our pieces being produced. I have  talked to the owners who have a proud history of production. I have seen the workers, the  people who work hard so that we can have a new piece of clothing. It is touching and it means  so much to me. There is a cost to clothing, so it shouldn’t be something we wear once and  throw away. 

Bonvion “The designers you know, and the ones, you don’t.” 
Bonvion is a concept online store specialized to deliver both trendy and timeless pieces from  small new indie brands up to the well-known big brands. We provide an amazing selection  from premium and luxury brands to men and women all around the European Union.  
Bonvion has been opened to create a destination for the modern cosmopolitan men and  women who are open for something new - like indie brands and industry changes like  sustainable and ethical fashion. Also, who cares about the quality of the products which they  are ordering. We would like to be a unique platform, which focuses on style and quality more  than a one season trend. Where you can be sure that we work super hard to create a  sustainable and as eco-friendly store as possible. But what we do to be sustainable and eco friendly? We use only recycled paper boxes, our tapes are also made of recycled plastic. We  deliver with companies, who are focusing on to reduce their carbon footprints. In this case we  are only delivering within the EU at this point. Fashion in the 2020s have to change, and we  would like to be one of the first adapters since it was super important to us way before. Bonvion also offers the opportunity to small indie brands to have their spotlight, and join not  just a store, but a lovely and supportive family. The Bonvion family.

Einstein-Newton,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear']","BRAND: Einstein-Newton DESCRIPTION: LOS ANGELES, 2010
“My amusing sayings earned me the nickname 'the funny German' from my friends. These witticisms became running gags in the clubs of Hollywood. Out of these running gags and the diverse influences of the city, Einstein Newton was born.”
Mario, Founder of Einstein Newton STATEMENTS AND ARTWORKS
Until Einstein Newton was founded, the only shirts to be found on the market had shallow, often tasteless statements.
Einstein Newton took it upon themselves to develop complex graphics with wit, originality and a great love of detail. We address any subject that we identify with as a team. We source our inspiration from life itself - the life and lifestyle of LA.

THE BRAND
Einstein Newton not only stands for fashion, but also for innovation and lifestyle. The brand is cosmopolitan, humorous and sometimes even cynical.
Einstein Newton is classified in the premium segment, which is where we also see ourselves. For ethical reasons, we cannot support cheap fashion.
Don’t buy cheap shi(r)t.

KEY PIECE
Prints are an expression of personality, mood and lifestyle - they are always a statement with which you identify. Printed shirts are therefore a central key piece - multifaceted and at the same time unique. Whether combined with a leather jacket and denim, or beneath a suit waiting for the evening party - it is the perfect item for every occasion.

DON'T BUY CHEAP SHI(R)T
Prints are our passion, our daily raison d'être, our personal motivation.
With their diverse colors and the clarity of our artworks, our shirts are unparalleled in the whole world. We developed a high-resolution printing method to put our ideas and designs into practice. We still set a benchmark in printing quality. Razor-sharp prints, as if on paper - an innovation by Einstein Newton.

Brand has started developing simultaneously with designers’ student years, continuing nowadays making their own big fashion shows where they display their new collections.

In last couple of years their design brought them to the very top of Croatian fashion world. Well-known of their commercial designer approach as well as representation of fashion as fun, from season to season they managed to surprise and thrill critics and public attending their fashion shows. Their fashion expression is based on parts of conscious trash. The inspiration for fashion shows had been taken from various beauty elections, trash icon – David Hasselhof, turbofolk pioneer of silicon beauty, Kasandra the nineties popular dance music singer, Split’s queen of aerobic – Nataša Bebić, and the last but not least, the well – known soap opera Dinastija. Beside within the context of fashion, the brand has been mentioned several times in camp culture context. Making a great step towards experimenting with adornments and at the same time changing the connotation of the same, lead the brand be connected with camp culture. Designers established brand itself by playing ‘’logo-maniacs’’, ironically printing logo everywhere as a status symbol.

Many of our regional stars had identified themselves with the brand.  All of that made contribution in making of recognizable fashion brand that ELFS is, know under the synonym “No.1 Fashion brand with LOVE!”

El Ganso,"['Menswear', 'Womenswear', 'Footwear']","BRAND: El Ganso DESCRIPTION: We were 2 young people passionate about fashion and eager to start our own brand. We spent several summers in London, learning English, and we saw clothes that we liked with a style that we didn't see in Spain. We thought that by drawing inspiration from that experience to create our product, giving it our own personality and selling it at an affordable price, it was possible to write our own story. Thus, in 2004 we jumped into the void. Like all beginners, we make mistakes at the beginning. 

The first plaid shirts we made lost the plaid after the first wash. The first pants, lost their color. We took the autumn-winter collection to the first fair we went to, when the fair was spring-summer! We were the only ones with coats and trench coats at that fair. Even so, we managed to open our first store in Madrid in 2006. At that time, sneakers were our flagship product. On a trip to Budapest, we saw some Slovak army sneakers from the mid-20th century. We took out a model inspired by them and El Ganso began to fly. Over time, we were gaining presence, opening more stores in Spain and, from 2011, abroad. We were also growing in the multi-brand market. We opened our first store in Paris on Rue des Rosiers, in Le Marais. That year we also opened in Lisbon, Santiago de Chile and London, in Carnaby Street. 

The British style with a fun and alternative point (classic but scoundrel, with vibes) has given rise to almost 150 points of sale in 6 countries: Spain, France, Portugal, Chile, Mexico and Kuwait. We have closed some stores along the way, but we have returned with more strength, freshness, desire, creativity and a great team. We also developed our digital channel, with a very clear commitment to www.elganso.com and the digitization of our points of sale, getting closer and closer to being a digital company with physical points of sale.

Ellesse,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Kidswear', 'Sportswear', 'Footwear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Ellesse DESCRIPTION: The Italian brand Ellesse began by creating innovative ski equipment that broke the boundaries between sports and fashion. Leonardo Servadio, the company’s founder, climbed to the top of snow-covered mountains and then successfully descended the tennis court. Today the famous brand is chosen not only by athletes but also by those who love comfortable and stylish clothes.

The name of the Italian brand is made up of the name and initials of the founder Leonardo Servadio. Until the mid-60s, the brand was simply L & S – “Elle” and “esse”. Only 10 years later came the “Semi palla” mark we know. It combines the cross-section of a tennis ball with tips similar to a pair of skis, symbolizing the brand’s heritage in both sports. Ellesse began placing their logo on the outside of their clothing. They are believed to have been one of the first to do so. That’s when the two letters merged into one full-fledged word, Ellesse.” “The famous 'half-ball' Ellesse logo combines a cross section of a tennis ball with the tips of a pair of skis, symbolising the brand's heritage in both of these sports. Ellesse began placing their logo on the outside of clothes, and are historically reported to have been one of the first brands to do this. It was immediately copied by other brands around the world.”

Elvang Denmark,['Accessories'],"BRAND: Elvang Denmark DESCRIPTION: We love exquisite textiles and classic design!
So much so, that we’ve specialized in alpaca wool and other irresistible and sustainable materials. Whether it’s a warming throw or a soft scarf, an Elvang design is a winning combination of Nordic aesthetics and Peruvian craftsmanship made to last. Clean and elegant with a sophisticated look in luxury quality. The story of Elvang is one of travelling out into the world, to witness quality and craftsmanship honed through centuries and not being able to let go of those impressions again.

That’s what happened after we returned from a backpacking trip to Peru in 2002. Here, we experienced the vast traditions of Peruvian culture, not to mention the alpaca and its extremely soft wool – considered one of the finest fibres in the world. One year later, Elvang the company was born, and we were the first to introduce throws made from alpaca wool in Scandinavia. Today, Elvang is sold in numerous countries worldwide.

It’s essential for us to make sustainable and responsible choices, securing proper conditions throughout our supply chain: from the alpaca shepherd’s pay to employee benefits at the local Peruvian weaving factory, the transportation of our goods and recycling packaging from our supplier as well as gift boxes made from recycled cardboard. We are also Fair Trade certified on the highest level with the World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO) as one of the only companies in Denmark.

Elvang is built on a foundation of ethics, integrity and respect – for our surroundings, the people we work with and the designs we make.

Her creative grandson inherited her passion for craftsmanship, genuine quality and a keen eye for detail. ELVINE was born, and has since then offered casual no-nonsense clothes with a touch of smartness and great fit for a relaxed lifestyle in the city.
In other words, sophisticated clothes for unsophisticated behaviour that suit sidewalks rather than catwalks.

WE LOVE GOTHENBURG
As true Gothenburgians with the harbour, a sense of humour and bad weather in our blood, the city has become the very basis of our existence. The unpredictable weather has pushed us to design solid, functional jackets for a city lifestyle and as inhabitants of Sweden’s second city with a strong worker culture, we feel comfortable in an effortless collection. But best of all is the pleasant atmosphere in Gothenburg, which has made ELVINE an exuberant and welcoming brand for all people.

EMILY AND FIN,['Womenswear'],"BRAND: EMILY AND FIN DESCRIPTION: Emily and Fin is an independent clothing brand for creative women that is rooted in friendship and complementary talents. Co-founders Emily Whittle and Fin Armour-Brown started on London’s famous Portobello Market by creating clothing from beautiful fabrics sourced from their travels. They travelled to colourful and beautiful destinations together, armed with sketch-pads bursting with designs just waiting to be made. The original creations that were born from these adventures laid the foundations for Emily and Fin. 20 years later many things have changed but they still have a passion for creating beautiful, considered clothing which is designed to last, made with thoughtful details and a playful use of colour.

Emily’s gift for print design and eye for distinctive fabrics, and Fin’s talent for pattern cutting and silhouette are a perfect match. Their instinctive ideas have a way of finding a natural creative balance. Emily and Fin harnesses these inherent skills to create clothing that is a collaboration of fabric and shape. We believe both are essential and one can’t exist without the other.

ergobag,"['Bags', 'Accessories', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: ergobag DESCRIPTION: In 2010, fascinated by the idea of developing a schoolbag inspired by trekking-backpacks, 4 friends developed the first ergonomic schoolbag in Cologne, Germany. From the very beginning ergobag is putting the protection of a kid’s health and the environment first. Setting new standards ever since – ergobag wants to inspire parents and their kids to discover new things, grow together and experience a colorful childhood. The ergonomic design relieves the child’s back and promotes an upright posture by combining the ergonomic system with all the necessary functions a schoolbag has to offer. As childrens’ taste changes quickly ergobag enables kids to switch between colorful patterns and styles through interchangeable Kletties and accessories such as Zip-Sets, Hangies or Zippies. ergobag wants to have a positive impact on the future that belongs to our children. Therefore, ergobag relies on recycling methods such as using recycled PET-bottles for the schoolbag’s fabrics. 
Moreover, the innovative brand keeps exploring natural resources such as BLOOM foam, a material consisting of algae extracts, and castor oil. With bluesign®, ergobag has found an independent and uncompromising partner who audits entire retail chains for resource conservation and the absence of harmful chemicals. Besides being bluesign® system partner, ergobag was able to launch several bluesign®-products in 2020 such as the ergobag minis, ergobag ease and the ECO HERO-Edition.

As one of very few brands, ergobag has been awarded with the “leader status” by the Fair Wear Foundation, an organization that helps to ensure the factories are safe, and workers benefit from fair working conditions.

The company Ermenegildo Zegna was founded in 1910 in Trivero, Italy by tailor and entrepreneur Ermenegildo Zegna, when Ermenegildo bought his father's textile looms. Zegna quickly gained a reputation for producing fine quality wool for suits, and by the end of the 1930s, the wool mill employed 1,000 workers. When Ermenegildo Zegna's sons Aldo and Angelo joined the company in 1942, it was renamed Ermenegildo Zegna and Sons.By 1945 Zegna fabrics were sold in over 40 countries. When Ermenegildo died in 1966, his sons took over the business, and two years later they launched a line of ready-to-wear suits produced in Zegna's factory in Novara. The first boutique was opened in Paris in 1980, followed by Milan in 1985. In its push to expand its customer base, Zegna also began designing new clothing lines to attract a younger clientele. In 1992, Zegna introduced two new lines, Zegna Soft and Zegna Sportswear, which offered more casual clothing styles. The company also introduced its own cologne in 1993. In Japan, in 1997, Zegna launched a new, Japan-only line, E.Z. That brand was also the company's first to be produced outside of Europe and under contract. Then, in 1998, the company introduced a new brand and retail format, Zegna Sport. As one of the biggest global producers of fine fabrics (more than 2 million metres per year), Zegna has been active in promoting improvements in wool production around the world. As well as producing men's suits for its own labels, it manufactures suits for labels such as Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Dunhill and Tom Ford.

She, a young Californian in a VW Beatle, driving to her holiday job. Their names: Doug Tompkins and Susie Russell. Their mutual way starts on Route 89 at Emerald Bay – and has lasted longer than both of them might have thought at the moment they met: three months later, they are married. Another five years later, they found a company that goes on to write fashion history: Esprit. In the beginning Esprit was just an idea that had to learn how to walk.

The rich and unique collections are designed to provoke an emotional response. The Antwerp-based brand is influenced by the numerous life experiences of its founders Esfan Eghtessadi and Inge Onsea. Esfan, the son of Nicole Cadine, grew up in a world of textiles, sketches and fashion collections. Inge had a vintage loving mother, was a fashion model and spent five years in India, where she fell in love with colors, prints and unexpected combinations.

In 1999 Esfan and Inge took a chance and launched a T-shirt collection. Four styles, twenty different colors: their response to the monochrome fashion landscape. After a year, the first store opened in Antwerp. Four seasons later, knitwear, jackets, dresses, shirts, and trousers in trendy colors, new materials, and an entire range of accessories were added. Essentiel Antwerp grew into a global brand with a powerful message of love, fun, and colorful surprises. A universal message that translates anywhere and everywhere in the world.

Her childhood and adolescence during the 70ies/80ies was strongly influenced by open-minded parents, who were strong proponents of egalitarian rights. Attending feminist movements and demonstrations as well as standing up for inclusivity from a young age on forged her character and gave rise to the avant-garde driven ambitions that she followed later in life. Growing up with no television but instead with many other useful tools, like a huge costume box, inspired strongly her imagination to create and explore various personas depending on the outfit combinations that were available to her. At the age of twelve she already received her calling to become a fashion designer and from then on engaged against all risks in reaching her desired goal.

Fabienne’s concept quickly gained popularity, driven by her ambition, courage, and positive attitude. In 2016, she decided to rebrand and launched her first ready-to-wear collection, featuring unique statement pieces for every woman. And so, Fabienne Chapot was born. With a boldly feminine spirit, we put vibrant colours and playful details at the heart of our aesthetic. Every season begins with a brush and paper, as designs are lovingly hand-painted in Amsterdam to ensure authenticity and add a personal touch. Styles are finished with signature embellishments like thoughtful embroideries and witty details. As we dare to elevate the everyday, we bring an outspoken, passionate and optimistic energy to everything we do. Our statement pieces are made to stand out while staying practical, for effortless everyday dressing that ignites the confidence of women everywhere.

Fabio Rusconi,['Footwear'],"BRAND: Fabio Rusconi DESCRIPTION: The Fabio Rusconi brand was created in 1998 on a return flight from Japan, a destination dear to the brand's CEO.

Since the beginning, the creative direction has been built upon a prototype of minimal sophistication. The design is high but not elitist, superb but never snobbish, cosmopolitan but with its heels rooted in its hometown of Florence, Italy. The most complex task is to adapt to the cultures and needs of all Fabio Rusconi customers around the world; to communicate the company's philosophy, namely that the customer is and remains the center of the brand's universe, which is made from leather but above all, emotion.

Twenty years have passed, and the results show that this choice has proven to be the right one, as long as no one lets their guard down, not even for a moment. Starting with Fabio himself.

Those who work at Fabio Rusconi have worn out their soles with travels, experiences and heightened attention to fashion trends and those who follow them.

Our shoes take us around the world, toward loved ones, toward a dream. Let's choose them carefully.

By Faith,['Jewelry'],"BRAND: By Faith DESCRIPTION: The dream of starting a business came early, we were in our early twenties when the opportunity came and the timing was right; leave what we had behind us and start something together. It felt like it was now or never, like it was meant to be. We knew that we were going to open a shop and we've always felt a gap in the range of jewelry in our town. This meant that the choice of shop became clear for us. Our family has been with us supporting us and helping us from the start when we took the brave step out to the unknown. We had nothing to lose, the whole family got involved and we built everything together. This family feel has remained within the company and has build our Faith spirit since the first day. Since the day we started-in march 2000 we've found a haven at our grandparents summer house. This is were we've been able to catch our breath, get new inspiration and a lot of our photo shoots have actually taken place there. The same year that we opened our store we bought our beloved Volkswagen bus that we took with us to every festival. The shop moved in with us in our little bus and we toured around and sold jewelry and accessories to happy festival goers. We remember this time with three words: so much fun! This experience that we got by creating these kind of encounters with our customers has been a kind of foundation for us and have since than wanting to keep a wide range of products to be able to keep our own inspiration, our own silver thread. Trends come and go, but we've always wanted to express our own voice and be able to share it.

Not long after this, new opportunities were starting to show. We moved in to a bigger place and at the same time  we started to produce our own products and it has been a wonderful journey. We've grown so much from this and have now decided that it is time to take a new step on our journey and develop Faith even more and find new worlds for us to explore. Not only that but we've started this amazing new webshop where we're going to be even more active from now on.

Our vision is to create jewelry with good sustainability, a clear feeling and so much love. With help from nature, encounters with wonderful people and new experiences, we want to get even further. So who knows, maybe you'll see us in touring around in our Volkswagen again soon...

Fashion4wellness,"['Womenswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Fashion4wellness DESCRIPTION: Fashion4Wellness: we are a manufacturer of hammam towels, beach towels, Foutas, Kikoys, Kimonos, tunics, pareos, blankets and plaids. We produce at small, traditional family owned companies in Turkey, Bali, Kenya and Tunisia. People, environment and society – we treat them all with care and respect. So that we remain successful as a company, today and tomorrow. And consumers can continue to enjoy our products.

Our products contain a lot of manual work, making each product unique. Our brands are: Fashion4Wellness, Balyy and Dreamtowel. Fashion4Wellness can be found at saunas and retailers who want to offer their customers something special. Our hammam towels are not only used on the beach or in the sauna, but increasingly also as a blanket, garment or accessory. For example, the Deniz hammam towel comes in 30 colors and 4 sizes. Dare to combine, dare to be yourself!

The hammam towel (also called pest(h)amal) originates from Turkey. Especially in the bathhouses (the hammams) or saunas, the hammam towels are used as a wrap, sauna towel, bath towel and drying towel.

A hammam towel absorbs a lot of humidity. The hammam towel can also be used as a beach towel. Hammam towels are thin, flexible, lightweight and dry quickly. They are ideal to take with you on a trip. A hammam towel is lighter than a regular towel and takes up less space in your luggage.

Hammam towels are also very suitable for use with babies. The hydrophilic cotton allows you to dry or wrap the baby with it. The hammam towel is therefore very nice to give as a maternity gift.

A Fouta has its origin in the North African countries. A Fouta is comparable to a hammam towel and has the same properties as a hammam towel. The difference is in the weaving machine and the country of origin.

Kikoys are of course also used in saunas, on the beach, at home, as a garment and decoration. They are rectangular in shape and used to be worn by men as a garment. Originally they come from Kenya and Tanzania.

The hammam towel, Fouta and Kikoy are increasingly used as a decorative tablecloth, blanket or plaid.

We believe our customer is everything! We are committed to making the best products for you. You are very welcome in our showroom in Zwanenburg (close to Amsterdam / Schiphol). Here you will find all beautifully produced products at a glance. We also produce for some brands under private label or as a limited edition.

FashionPower,,"BRAND: FashionPower DESCRIPTION: In 1897, following a thorough training from the Trappist monks, Jan Nelemans started his own tailoring business in Zundert. It was the start of a long family tradition in clothing. In 1949, the first store opened. 20 more shop openings would follow over the years throughout the Netherlands. They sold fashion for the whole family, from socks to overcoats and a large variety of outdoor clothing.

As a true family business, the whole family worked within the firm and daily business revolved around clothing and customers. The current generation, Reg and Ronald Nelemans, launched what is now FashionPower and chose to design and develop functional activewear, outdoor clothing, leisurewear and dress-up sets. We feel responsible and act sustainable. In recent years we have developed many new products that are recycled or upcycled with bamboo, coffee, coconut and recycled polyester. We also aim to reduce the discharge of all hazardous chemicals to a minimum. We use a technique called dope dyeing to achieve this. 

Our coconut / coffee treatments and yarns are developed through a very sustainable process. Coconut shells and coffee grounds are processed into carbon. This is done by means of electrification whereby, instead of during normal combustion, very little CO² is released.

Bamboo is a very durable and natural material to use as a basis for a treatment since bamboo is a fast-growing grass, requiring much less water and no pesticides than, for example, cotton.

Pure carbon is added to our treatments and yarns which replace chemicals in the production process. This way we add functionalities in a sustainable way.

Functional polyester is the perfect fabric for high-quality sportswear.
Polyester made from recycled clothing or plastic (PET) bottles can also be used to make new functional sportswear. Doing this helps to reduce the “waste mountain”. And what’s more, this method doesn’t require the use of large amounts of fossil raw materials. The resulting fabric is no different from regular polyester – it looks and feels the same. All our recycled polyester garments are GRS certified.

By using recycled polyester, we support the circular economy and help reduce waste, Co2 emissions, and energy consumption.

In dope dyeing, yarn is dyed during the spinning process. Colour pigments and polymer pellets are combined using heat and melted directly into the yarn as it is spun.

We are a responsible partner to our suppliers and employees. We are committed to creating the best conditions for all our stakeholders by meeting the goals set out in our corporate social responsibility policy.

We are always in search of innovative finishes and solutions with which we contribute our fair share to the circular economy and ensure a more sustainable future.",https://www.fashionpower.eu,"{'neg': 0.014, 'neu': 0.886, 'pos': 0.099, 'compound': 0.9876}",0.9876,Positive,en

One is passionate about finding jewels in the fashion industry, the other is dedicated to sustainability and social justice. With FeminIst we have combined these two heart projects and are creating 100% eco-friendly, fair and vegan designer fashion. 

Why us?
We are confident that our clothes are filling a gap in the fashion industry. The world has already seen sustainable basics, what we are missing is sustainable – yet killer chic – fashion. Each of our pieces has a unique designer twist. There is no question about the high quality of our fabrics: we use GOT certified organic cotton, vegan silk (cupro) and Tencel. Our clothes are produced in small, family-run ateliers in the fashion capital of Istanbul with great attention to detail. Feminism and fashion
The name ""FeminIst"" has a meaning, of course. Feminism means that all people are granted the same rights – regardless of their sex or gender. Sadly, most women who work in the fast fashion industry are not given any rights: they work under terrifying conditions, get extremely low wages, work countless overtime hours and are exposed to sexualized and verbal violence. ⁠With our name ""feminIst"" we want to draw attention to the horrible working conditions in the fast fashion industry and togther with you, we want to show the world that there is a completely other, fair way of designer fashion.

And now?
We want to show together with you that sustainability and fairness has found its place in the high fashion industry. 
We see that our clothes sell very well in the store, because our customers want to touch and try them on. Especially the vegan silk inspires customers in the long run. Therefore, we are exclusively looking for partners who share our vision and take our special designer pieces into their store.

If you like our fashion, please send us an inquiry! We are looking forward hear from you!

Femkit,"['Womenswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Femkit DESCRIPTION: The story of Femkit began with the search for a simple, classic dress that flatters the figure and is affordable at the same time. It had to have a certain 'je ne sais quoi', be suitable for every silhouette and occasion, and of course it couldn't be without pockets. Since designer Cindy Schlobinsky couldn't find such a dress through the usual channels, she designed her own.

Thus, in 2011, Femkit was born. Initially focusing on jersey fabrics and twenties-inspired blouse dresses, feminine silhouettes with Viennese seams and sophisticated fits gradually emerged. Cindy's designs are classic and wearable. They breathe the air of yesterday and touch the present. Femkit creates timeless favorites that make every woman's heart beat faster. Wholesale

The business prospered, and a new shop was opened in Via Piave in 1932. The couple's five daughters went to work for the firm. German designer Karl Lagerfeld joined Fendi in 1965. Lagerfeld immediately created the inverted FF logo that joined the growing list of international status symbols, and then set about, aided and abetted by the sisters, to revolutionize the treatment of fur and other clothing. Marvin Traub, president of Bloomingdale's, discovered Fendi's leather goods and introduced them to the United States. In 1969 Fendi presented its first ready-to-wear fur collection at Palazzo Pitti in Florence. When the sisters could not find the fabric clothes they wanted to show under the furs their women ready-to-wear line was born (in 1977), again to great success.

Thank you for your interest in our company profile. In the following you will find information on the company's history, the product range of our branches and the online shop as well as the philosophy of the company and its employees.

With the establishment of Mechthild Brune GmbH on July 18, 1995, the foundation stone for today's company was laid. In September of the same year, the company founder Heribert Brune opened the first Mephisto store on Kettwiger Strasse in Essen. For 22 years now, this branch, in the center of the Ruhr area, has stood for expert and customer-oriented service. Encouraged by the long-term success of the Essen branch, another Mephisto shoe store of Mechthild Brune GmbH opened in September 1999 in the Westenhellweg in Dortmund. Since then, our Mephisto team has been looking after satisfied customers in this branch, which is closely connected to the Ruhr area. Mechthild Brune GmbH would like to continue the well-known service on the Internet. On the website www.mephistoschuhe-online.de, customers outside the Ruhr area can now also purchase cheap and high-quality shoes. The usual service is supplemented by a simple ordering process, among other things. 

The cornerstone for the continued success of the company, the high level of customer loyalty and, last but not least, the satisfaction of our valued customers is the high quality of our products, complemented by the motivated, competent and friendly employees. Detailed advice before buying is one of the most important maxims of our branches. However, it is crucial that the service does not stop after the purchase! It goes without saying that we offer our customers the right care products and an expert repair service. 

In our Mephisto online shop as well as in the Essen and Dortmund branches, women and men alike receive a wide range of the latest shoe fashion from the Mephisto brand. Anyone who opts for a shoe from this manufacturer is primarily relying on a functional, high-quality shoe suitable for everyday use. The manufacturer also attaches great importance to innovative technology and comfort. Only then do the optical parameters come into play, which, however, must not negatively affect the wearing comfort under any circumstances. Depending on the intended use, the technical features differ noticeably. This achieves a quality that optimally supports the wearer at all times. After all, comfort, functionality and durability are outstanding attributes of the Mephisto shoes on offer. This is confirmed, among other things, by numerous patent solutions such as soft-air technology or the use of Gore-tex materials. True to the motto: Design follows function! This applies to our business shoes as well as to leisure and outdoor shoes. In each of these categories, a large selection of models also provides an additional unique selling point. The Mephisto portfolio ranges from sandals and elegant business shoes to off-road hiking boots.

FILA,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Footwear', 'Sportswear']","BRAND: FILA DESCRIPTION: FILA’s story dates to 1911 and a small Italian city close to the Alps. Four brothers provided the locals of their home town, Biella, with warm clothes and had a vision: to combine high-quality materials, classic design and fierce practicality. Founded in 1923 and initially focusing on underwear, this dedication soon led to popularity beyond Italian borders. The global breakthrough happened in 1974 thanks to a sportswear collection that revolutionised design, particularly in tennis. The White Line Collection by designer Pier Luigi Rolando was provocative, unconventional yet simple and honest. It offered authentic sportswear a special cosmopolitan charm. FILA brought in some new colours, not only to white-material-dominated tennis world but also to classic, timeless looks that have made it around the world.

To this day, FILA represents sophistication as well as Italian craftsmanship and keeps impressing beyond the realm of sports, reaching the streets of metropolises and runways of high-end fashion shows. More than 100 years of success are based on the unwavering philosophy of innovation and the spirit of always being on the move.

In 2009, Guillaume Philibert wanted to design a premium sneaker at a fair price point. This led to the birth of the Low Top. The first shoe to bridge the gap between streetwear and high fashion.

FIL NOIR,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: FIL NOIR DESCRIPTION: FIL NOIR is a piece of Italian clothing culture, because the history of the brand begins over a hundred years ago in Certaldo, Tuscany, where the brothers Luca and Lorenzo Manzini took over their father's men's underwear manufacture in 1899 and led it to success.
With a passion for tailoring and fine materials, a feeling for zeitgeist and commercial skills, they created the first men's shirts. Impeccable, handcrafted production, the finest cotton fabrics, exquisite ingredients and fair prices were guarantees of success, beyond national borders. When an earthquake destroyed the region's yarn factories at the beginning of the 20th century, the brothers made a virtue out of necessity: They sewed the only remaining yarn, it was black. The white shirt with the black seam went perfectly with the black suit and thus became the favorite shirt of style-conscious Parisian businessmen: Everyone wanted the shirt with the “fil noir”, the “black thread” - the birth of the brand name and an international success story that abruptly took place in 1915 ended: Italy entered the First World War, sent its men to the front, and so the Manzini brothers had no choice but to close the family business - the end for FIL NOIR.

After homesteading in Nebraska and roaming the country as a railroad conductor, he moved to the small city of Seattle, Washington in the 1890s. Filson's timing couldn't have been better. By 1897, the Great Klondike Gold Rush was on, and thousands of fortune hunters were stampeding into Seattle, headed north. Armed with a strong work ethic, a reputation for honesty and several years' experience outfitting Pacific Northwest settlers and prospectors, C. C. Filson was ready to stake his claim to fame. Here is what he had to say in our 1914 catalog:

""To our customers: if a man is going North, he should come to us for his outfit, because we have obtained our ideas of what is best to wear in that country from the experience of the man from the North -- not merely one -- but hundreds of them.

The place where land ends has intrigued man for centuries, fostering both a real and a romantic relationship with the sea; a relationship that runs deep in our narrative. Since day one we have taken a pioneering approach to making better and more sustainable product, challenging and innovating, seeking alternatives to what has gone before. We’re committed to making informed decisions about our impact on the environment and are constantly trying to push boundaries to make the best product we can.

FinnComfort,['Footwear'],"BRAND: FinnComfort DESCRIPTION: Humans differ from animals in their upright gait. This cultural and historical achievement is caught and cushioned by our feet - which Leonardo da Vinci already admired as true “technical masterpieces”. With 26 bones, they accommodate almost a quarter of the bones of the human skeleton as well as 13 joints, 33 ligaments and more than a hundred muscles.

The catch is that our feet are designed by nature for a barefoot nomadic life and not for modern, mostly urban living environments, where they are penned in cages made of stockings and often unhealthy, oppressive footwear. As a result - while we circumnavigate the world at least once in the course of our lives - many foot problems arise that affect knees, hips and back in the long term.

Because what many do not know: misalignments of the feet, incorrect loading, posture and gait affect the whole body and can cause unpleasant complaints.


At FinnComfort, we always have an open ear when it comes to developing new, well-fitting, comfortable shoes. We focus on the needs of our customers and are committed to further optimizing all products.

As different as our range of feel-good shoes is, our feet and their requirements are just as different.

You can well imagine that every type of foot entails a completely different task in the development and production of a shoe.

From meticulously hand-painting wooden heels to developing new ways of working with leather with the help of local tanneries, FINSK works very closely with the artisans to combine traditional shoe-making know-how with the brand’s modern aesthetic and create one-of-a-kind FINSK designs.

FIORANGELO,['Footwear'],"BRAND: FIORANGELO DESCRIPTION: FIORANGELO: the history of Italian handmade footwear since 1976

Challenges, success and endless endeavours. If we had to describe our story, this is how we would do it.
We began in a “privileged location”, in the heart of the footwear district in the Marche region – the “Shoes Valley” admired and envied worldwide, where knowing how to make Italian handmade footwear is a skill acquired from an early age. The smell of the leather and that unique way of moulding it into small works of art has been handed down from one generation to the next – a priceless heritage.
Our creations meet consumers’ requirements and expectations through design, guaranteeing at the same time comfort and high-quality standards. We believe there is no other quality such as that of the Made in Italy and our work is the best way to prove it. Wholesale

Fjällräven,"['Accessories', 'Bags', 'Menswear', 'Womenswear']","BRAND: Fjällräven DESCRIPTION: Fjällräven was born out of one man’s vision: a vision to make nature accessible to more people. Åke Nordin was born in Örnsköldsvik, on Sweden’s High Coast, in 1936. Combining rolling hills, deep forests and sheltered coastline it was the perfect playground for a young, curious Åke. And it was on one of his many adventures that the seed for Fjällräven was planted, deep in Åke’s mind.

The idea arose out of necessity: to create a backpack that swallowed up gear, but sat comfortably on his back. Åke knew there must be a way. With his mother’s sewing machine and his father’s tools, Åke created a wooden-framed backpack in his basement. And with it, the seed was sown. 10 years later, in 1960, in that same basement, Åke founded Fjällräven and launched his first product for sale. Guess what is was? Yep, a backpack; this time with an aluminium frame.

During the 1960s and 70s, fuelled by Åke’s stubborn belief that there must always be a way – a practical solution –the Fjällräven product range expanded significantly, with tents, sleeping bags, jackets and trousers. The Greenland Jacket, the Expedition Down Jacket and the Kånken backpack proved to be defining products. Virtually every other Swede, from avid trekker to enthusiastic nature lover, wore and trusted Fjällräven.

The mere mention of The Modern House has people dreaming over the latest architectural gem that may (or more likely may not) become theirs one day. Fair to say Matt Gibberd & Albert Hill have rewritten the rule book in estate agency with a radically unique approach - to market properties based on design merit, rather than geographic location. Our collaboration has come about through a common appreciation of simple things that function beautifully, and beautiful things that function simply. These shared values led us to sketch a classic city bag, but to produce it with the care and attention of an artisan maker. Working with a Somerset leather factory and using dead-stock fabrics, we have created a new staple tote for The Modern House team. Designed to be carried or worn over shoulder, the bag neatly accommodates laptop/ keys/ card etc - the essentials of a team who spend their time around the most prestigious architectural design and most demanding of clients.

We are happy to now offer these limited run bags for sale via the Folk or The Modern House websites. Available in any colour, so long as its black.

“Simplicity in design, sustainability in fabrication, Somerset in manufacture - whats not to love?! We are so happy to create something useful and good looking for our friends at The Modern House” Cathal McAteer, Founder & Creative Director of Folk 
“We’ve really enjoyed collaborating with the good folks from Folk on a project that’s about supporting British craftsmanship, timeless detailing, truth to materials and respect for the environment. It’s difficult to do the simple things well, and this versatile tote treads a careful line between being smart enough for a meeting and discreet enough for the night bus,” Matt Gibberd, Co Founder of The Modern House.

FOX FACTOR,['Womenswear'],"BRAND: FOX FACTOR DESCRIPTION: FOX FACTOR'S STORY
Fox Factor arose, fundamentally, from the idea of equality. That every woman, of every size, should be able to wear the latest fashion trends and feel amazing in it. Unfortunately, the fashion industry has not caught up to speed yet. We found ourselves looking for those same fashionable jeans that were available in smaller sizes, and couldn’t find them in plus-size jeans. So we made them. No more compromising on style or fit, no more low standards: you deserve nothing but the best. It doesn’t matter whether you’re picking up your kids from school, meeting your friends for a night on the town, or picking up a guy at a bar … Whatever your life looks like, we want you to put on a pair of Fox Factor jeans and immediately feel that boost of confidence that makes you think “Yeah, let’s do this. ”There’s so much more we could say about our jeans, but at the end of the day there is only one thing that matters. That you put them on and not only look amazing but feel amazing as well.

Fraenck,"['Bags', 'Accessories', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: Fraenck DESCRIPTION: Fraenck - a Dutch sustainable fashion brand and social enterprise, founded in 2018. It all started with designer duo Ho&Mulder, who met each other at the Academy of the Arts in Arnhem. They started working together until finally founding a brand that combines all things important to them.

Design.
The Fraenck collection is designed and made in Arnhem, NL. Timeless, functional and durable.

Sustainable.
All items are made using recycled and upcycled leftovers from the Dutch manufacturing industry.

Social.
Every piece is handmade in our studio, by people with certain disabilities. At Fraenck they learn valuable skills. With these skills they become more independent.

Vegan.
Fraenck uses vegan materials. Fraenck is a slow fashion brand. Don’t worry, this doesn’t mean the company is slow ☺! The brand brings timeless items which can be combined endlessly every season. The only trend the brand believes in is the one on sustainability and transparency. By wearing Fraenck you’re making a strong statement against fast fashion. A statement that needs to be made, again and again. Join the cause and contribute to a fashion industry that is more transparent, more sustainable and most of all: kind to their workers.

The studio of Fraenck is a safe haven for individuals who need time to work on their skills. Skills they need to adapt to our modern society and challenging demands. Whether one needs to work on their language or social skills – at Fraenck we work together on a bright(er) future.

The collection is currently evolving beyond sustainable bags and accessories. Before Fraenck, co-founder Ratna gained a lot of experience designing and manufacturing clothing.  During masters at Central St. Martins, but also later at fashion label RATNA HO. This experience results in a fastidious yet outspoken collection of sustainable dresses, skirts, coats and home-wear items, which will soon be released under the banner of Fraenck. With the same transparent and inclusive values and goals.

Frank Daniel owes its name to one of the brothers: Daniele Franceschin. Frank Daniel belts were mainly distributed around Western Europe, aimed at a medium-high target.

 In the mid-90’s, they introduce the production of handbags and the company begins to expand into the extra European markets, particularly in Asia and especially in Japan. In 2016 we boosted Frank Daniel, continuing with the distribution of belts and introducing men’s and women’s footwear. We still keep the tradition by manufacturing everything in Italy. Frank Daniel’s collections were born with the goal to dress men and women both in leisure and work attire with a sober look, always keeping up with the shapes, materials and colours of the moment. The variety of the models varies between the most classic derby’s and oxford’s to the most sought-after boots and sneakers that range in details and finishing touches.

Freitag,"['Bags', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Freitag DESCRIPTION: Our Story

In 1993, graphic designers Markus and Daniel Freitag were looking for a functional, water-repellent and robust bag to hold their creative work. Inspired by the multicolored heavy traffic that rumbled through the Zurich transit intersection in front of their flat, they developed a messenger bag from used truck tarpaulins, discarded bicycle inner tubes and car seat belts. This is how the first FREITAG bags took shape in the living room of their shared apartment – each one recycled, each one unique. With their innovation, the brothers inadvertently triggered a seismic event in the world of bag making. Its tremors have since made themselves felt in Zurich and the cities of Europe and spread all the way to Asia, making FREITAG the unofficial outfitter of all urban, bike-riding individualists.
The first F13 TOP CAT messenger bag has since spawned a full range of over 80 different models for all your carrying needs: from smartphone and laptop sleeves via backpacks and on to handbags, shoppers and travel bags. And since 2009, FREITAG has been paying tribute to the traditional art of bag-making with unique, first-class one-offs made from plain-colored vintage truck tarpaulins.
FREITAG has been headquartered at the Nœrd industrial complex in Zurich-Oerlikon since 2011. This is where the truck tarps we collect are taken apart, washed and cut up. FREITAG still belongs to the two Freitag brothers, and, as Creative Directors, they still oversee each new model through to series production.
In 2014, they gave themselves a new raw material to play with: F-ABRIC. Their rugged, completely compostable textiles are based on bast fibers that are produced using a minimum of resources within a 2500-kilometer radius of headquarters. F-ABRIC thus more than lives up to the FREITAG philosophy: We think and act in cycles.

Frieda & Freddies,['Womenswear'],"BRAND: Frieda & Freddies DESCRIPTION: Frieda & Freddies New York symbolically translates into men and woman, originating from the east coast, USA.  In the 1970s Frieda & Freddies was the name of two infamous Discotheques in Miami and New York, with the label being personified by two little Chihuahuas named “Frieda & Freddies”.

Amongst other things, the MIAMI VICE TV series was set in the two clubs; simultaneously a wild, screaming and colourful clothing collection was based around the clubbing scene featuring T-Shirts and sweatshirts. Within no time the Frieda & Freddies collection advanced into a Must - Have brand relying largely on funky Disco prints and Hawaii Shirts. Not only did countless Hollywood stars, such as Jackie O, Steve McQueen & Paul Newman wear Frieda & Freddies to fame, but further was the cast of MIAMI VICE clothed in Frieda’s couture. As a result, Frieda & Freddies became absolute cult in the 80’s, far beyond Miami and New York. Nevertheless the decline of the Discotheque are in the 90’s also affected the Hype around Frieda & Freddies.

This changed drastically, when in 2005 Lebek & Friends took over the trademark rights and developed a collection for Europe.  The fresh and young collection were vastly extended to an extensive lifestyle collection and within two years a Europe wide export with a multitude of sales agencies was set up successfully.

What started off as a casual business trip for them, turned into an epic adventure through the highs and lows of the Far East. Seeking initially to research business opportunities, a delay at a local train station resulted in a major detour. They returned from it with crates and stories! The rising sun flag became the brand’s symbol and an inspiration for what has become a highly successful idea: to make great garments that suit every individual, reflect ones personality and make you feel cool at ease. The brand was launched during the summer of 2003 and its tees and cargo shorts became directly a hit, surpassing expectations and setting the standards for further expansion of the brand. In just a few years, with hard work and determination, and with the collection becoming richer and more complete the commercial success of the European fashion company took off. Funky Buddha has become - in a short period of time – an international fashion Retailer and the cult fashion brand for those who love to wear clothes inspired by values such as freedom, respect for the individual and respect for the environment.

Furla,['Bags'],"BRAND: Furla DESCRIPTION: In 1927 the history of the Furla family firm was beginning in the erudite and sophisticated city of Bologna. Protagonists Aldo and Margherita Fulanetto set themselves the challenge of starting a company – one which was eventually to grow into a world-renowned leather goods brand. In 1955 Aldo opened the first Furla store on Via Ugo Bassi in the heart of Bologna, selling leather bags and accessories. In the 1970s, when the baton was passed on to his children Giovanna, Carlo and Paolo Furlanetto, the first collection of bags carrying the Furla logo was launched. The collections grew at the same pace as the company. With the 1980s just around the corner, Giovanna flanked her father making her own stylistic contributions, while Carlo and Paolo were mostly in charge of the brand’s strategy for growth. 

Furla invented a new concept of luxury which was close to every woman and immediately became an international 'must.” By the end of 2008, 296 single-brand Furla stores have been established, positioned on the most important international shopping streets, and more than a thousand sales outlets from shops to department stores.

It was early 2015 when Brands-360 obtained the official license for Gaastra Footwear, which forged a special relationship between the two Dutch companies. Gaastra’s nautical roots made it even more special as there is so much rich heritage from which to draw inspiration.

GABBA,"['Menswear', 'Accessories', 'Denim']","BRAND: GABBA DESCRIPTION: GABBA is a family-owned denim brand with more than 30 years of experience in making jeans. The brand was founded by Ole and Karen Madsen with a vision of creating a modern denim brand, focusing on quality fabrics and attention to detail. With a global mindset, we gather inspiration from around the world – we find originality in our in-house denim archive to create four annual collections, each of them well-balanced, unique and with a true denim identity. We work with the same attention to detail and have the same never-ending obsession with denim as our founders, guarding our prevailing values: Denim, Design and Dedication - the backbone of GABBA for more than 30 years.

Since our foundation, denim has been the core of our business and it is safe to say that we have indigo flowing in our veins. Since the very first pair of jeans, we have used the same blue-colour thread for the split inseams on our jeans.

The same thread is used for the signature chain stitch on the waistband. A gold-plated, then dyed blue raised GABBA rivet is found on our coin pockets as a unique detail which gains patina after each wash. Our denim identity shines through on our non-denim products as well. We add rivets on pants, knitwear and jackets, creating a blue thread through the entire range of our products.

Gallo,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Kidswear', 'Bodywear', 'Footwear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Gallo DESCRIPTION: Milano, 1927
This is when it all started; then it moved to Desenzano, Garda Lake, by the end of the 1930s. A history with so many records set and written in the name of absolute excellence, a deep-rooted and inalienable company value. Whether it is for men, kids, babies or, later on, women, Gallo has definitely changed the concept of socks. Indeed, this is revolutionized and becomes exclusive creation: in the 1960s, THE FIRM came up with the innovative perforated socks, as well as with the first NEWBORN socks. Gallo makes the smallest socks in the world.

Always at the forefront, the company has managed to combine the poetry of craftsmanship with the technology of industrialization. They have always used the best raw materials and manufacturing techniques, as well as the latest machinery, but also traditional Bentley looms which allow, even today, to create and perpetuate yarn processing that otherwise would be lost.

However, it was in 1998 that a real Gallo revolution began, thanks to an intuition: the purchase of socks for necessity had to be turned into impulse buying. SO, THE SOCKS FROM GREY TURN TO COLORED. From then on, socks, knitwear, jackets and accessories came in an explosion of multicolor stripes in variable proportions, bold play of contrasts, unconventional style and high recognizability. Stripe after stripe, collection after collection, the new socks look was defined.

The original proposals of the Collection line were flanked by the more sophisticated and haut de gamme Tailoring line: a revolution in the revolution.

Two complementary aesthetic codes, to be worn alternately, depending on the occasion. In any case, a sock to show as a graphic extension of one's personality. A succession of colors and pioneering initiative. A success that today is on the feet of men, women and children.

Today curiosity continues to drive us forwards. It unlocks creative thinking and has led to many of GANT’s shirtmaking innovations. But it’s a mindset that extends beyond the design studio.

In 1977, a Dutchman named Martin Kouwenberg began importing their jeans. Their shared passion for jeans started a friendship, which turned into a partnership and eventually created Garcia. A brand born in Italy and raised in The Netherlands. Life is all about making new connections. When you share a real connection and a common passion, you become one family. Better together

Gardenia Copenhagen,['Footwear'],"BRAND: Gardenia Copenhagen DESCRIPTION: The story about Gardenia Copenhagen started three generations ago in 1941 when the company’s founder, Herman Gutkin, started manufacturing wooden clogs in a small basement on Nørrebro. It was in the 1950’s that Herman decided to change the direction of the company and started to focus on fashionable women footwear. The stiletto came to play an important role in securing the company’s position on the Danish market during the 1960’s, as Gardenia Copenhagen were among the first players to introduce high heels and pointy toes in Denmark.

By focusing on consistency and remaining faithful towards its roots – Gardenia Copenhagen managed to establish itself as one of the most successful shoe brands on the market.

The family-run business has ever since stayed faithful towards its values and traditions within Danish design and is today highly characterized by its classic and exclusive profile. The stiletto is still a big part of the company’s DNA, together with craftmanship, high quality and great comfort, as well as its strong focus on seasonal trends.

76 years later, Gardenia Copenhagen remains a key player within the Danish fashion industry. A key success-factor has been the company’s ability to stay curious and alert to its external environment.

The universe of Gardenia Copenhagen has come a long way since the beginning and is today characterized by beautiful silhouettes, classic and edgy designs, the highest quality in terms of materials and function, and not the least care for details.

Gardenia Copenhagen does not merely adapt according to tendencies – but is a trendsetting name that pushes the boundaries and inspires new trends.

Today the vision and unconditional love for the product is carried on by the grandson of Herman; Allan Gutkin, who is today the CEO and director of Gardenia Copenhagen.

Geisha,"['Womenswear', 'Kidswear']","BRAND: Geisha DESCRIPTION: Geisha Fashion was founded in 2001 by Mark Jessurun, who had a background in fashion production as well as in retail, having had his own clothing stores in The Netherlands. Combining these qualities turned out to be an interesting combination. One of the problems Jessurun endured as a retailer, proved to be the bad fit of many jeans. His customers were looking for a pair of jeans that suited them and made them look and feel better. Jeans they could fall in love with and buy over and over again, without having to try piles of denim every time they wanted a new pair.Jessurun's ultimate challenge was to create the perfect fit and a fresh new brand to go with it. Creativity is one of the key words: playing with fashion themes, colours, prints and fabrics. Anticipation on trends is very important, feeding on books, magazines, exhibitions, city trips and street style. Efficiency is another, resulting in shorter time to market. But also technical skills, know-how and budget monitoring are required. These key virtues prove how important the styling department is within the Geisha company. For independant woman of all ages, who like to dress according to how they feel. The collection balances between playful and ladylike, with fresh floral prints, comfortable fabrics and nice knitwear.
Geisha produces four collections a year, consisting of numerous pieces, available in different colours and fabrics.

Love,
Geisha team

Gem Induztrie,['Womenswear'],"BRAND: Gem Induztrie DESCRIPTION: After the birth of our daughter, my husband and I made the conscious decision to live a more sustainable life. Not long after we embarked on this lifestyle, I found myself becoming more conscious of the products I was choosing to purchase, and how these products were manufactured and their impact on the environment. As someone passionate about fashion and style, and in the middle of creating my denim jeans brand, I was especially shocked by the fashion world’s harmful impact on the earth through fast fashion practices. As someone committed to sustainable living, I knew there had to be a sustainable way to create our  denim jeans.

Fortunately, there was.

After much effort, We were able to source high-quality recycled denim fabric produced from plastic bottles blended with virgin denim, and made by people who are paid fairly for their labour in safe working environments.

Finally, Geminduztrie was born, and my desire for eco-chic was realised.

From the moment you put on a pair of Geminduztrie premium denim jeans, you will immediately feel the difference in fit, quality, and style. Our denim jeans have been designed to be classic and stylish so as to withstand fashion trends, allowing our jeans to be worn and loved longer as part of our sustainability vision.

By being sold exclusively in our online store, we pass the savings onto you so that you can own a high-quality sustainable pair of denim jeans at an affordable price. And by purchasing a pair of Geminduztrie denim jeans, you are helping to support our earth and our family company’s sustainability vision.

Gemmi,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Kidswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Gemmi DESCRIPTION: We are Gemmi. A fur outerwear brand from Finland, established as a sartorial antidote to the harsh Winters in the North. Gemmi introduced its own take on luxury streetwear already in the 80’s.  Today our handmade products represent a unique fusion of luxurious fur and streetwear aesthetics. Nordic Luxury
Gemmi is a family-owned company, continuing a long tradition of making high quality fur products in the small town of Loviisa, located in Southern Finland. Our brand's history dates back to the early 70’s. We gave new life to the Gemmi name in 2014, when we re-opened our hometown’s fur factory. We had been impressed by a team so proud of their workmanship and committed to their customers. We were also intrigued by the brand, that from the early days created its own unique style of modern fur coats. We saw an opportunity to develop fur products that already were well-designed, high-quality, functional and responsibly made, into a contemporary fur outerwear brand with more clear influences from Nordic design traditions.

Our essential fur outerwear include light, reversible fur coats and vests. The combination of windproof technical fabric with luxurious fox fur makes these light garments the most comfortable outerwear for cold, windy days.  Our take on the traditional parkas has a pure and minimalistic form, with a lining made of luxurious fur. We have added a capsule collection of puffer coats with fur details in contrasting colors, added both for functionality and design. 

We use Saga quality fur skins, responsibly farmed in Finland. The durability of high-quality fur material, combined with our signature style of Nordic simplicity, make Gemmi fur outerwear a sustainable choice for Winter. Surplus fur material is used to make fashion-forward accessories, often designed to protect against cold and windy weather.  

Gemmi’s collection is sold through selected boutiques and department stores globally, as well as in our Flagship Store in Helsinki and online.

We don’t complicate things. Our strength has always been keeping things simple, which applies to our designs and working methods alike.

The focus back then was on tricot tops and initially, Gina Tricot had just 12 stores, all of which were located in Sweden.

Today, Gina Tricot has more than 160 stores located throughout Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Germany. It also offers online shopping throughout Europe.

The Italian market represented the launch pad for the company, but it is thanks to abroad that the brand has been able to establish itself, especially in Holland and Belgium. Over time, the brand has acquired an ever greater prestige, thanks also to the consolidated leadership of Giorgio Cugnigni, Lino Donnari and Marcello Fratini, who have led the brand to reach today such a reputation as to place itself on the same level as the most important native brands, for quality, originality and comfort of its footwear.

Gloverall,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Kidswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Gloverall DESCRIPTION: A story of craftsmanship, authenticity and service.

Five years after the end of World War II Gloves and Overall wholesalers H&F Morris, Harold and Freda, were offered a large quantity of surplus military Duffle Coats which quickly sold out in camping and leisurewear shops.

This success prompts Harold, son of a master tailor, and Freda to produce their own Duffle coats for their new company Gloverall.

Harold decides to refine the duffle coats; he replaces the thick jute rope fastening, which can be difficult to attach to the coats, with leather straps and also introduces an Italian check back fabric. Gloverall, now well established and selling in major stores worldwide, commemorates its Golden Jubilee in 2001 with a special edition Duffle coat made from 100% Angora wool.

In 2010 Gloverall, on approaching its 60th Anniversary, reproduce modern versions of its iconic 1950s Duffle coat with the original
2014 - The 1951 Collection took inspiration from a set of black-and-white photographs chronicling the early days of British Grand Prix. Photographed wearing Gloverall’s iconic Monty Duffle coat, Brooks is captured alongside racing legends Sterling Moss and Mike Hawthorn while racing at the Monaco Grand Prix in 1957.

The 1951 Collection made a contemporary reevaluation of the Monty duffle coat, updating the classic boiled wool style featuring appliqué racking inspired motifs and pins. Other outerwear highlights include all-weather raincoats, sport mid-length car coats and quilted rally jackets.

Premium British fabrics are still prominent. Tweeds from Abraham Moon, Fox Brothers and Harris Tweed feature alongside waxed coated cottons by Halley Stevens and boned cottons by British Millerain.

GLOWE,"['Maternity wear', 'Womenswear']","BRAND: GLOWE DESCRIPTION: I’ve worked in fashion my whole career; and it was only when I was pregnant with my first child that I realized just how unfit for purpose the vast majority of maternity clothing is,” says Lucy. From her own experience the final straw came when she was desperately trying to breastfeed her crying newborn in a restaurant. She was wearing a “nursing top” so overly complicated that in the end, Lucy’s mom had to cut the top open with scissors borrowed from the waiter. It was clear maternity clothing needed to be thought about in a radically different way and so, GLOWE was born.

Lucy’s fashion career spans nearly 20 years as a respected leader and creative director at some of the world’s most renowned brands such as Burberry, Calvin Klein, Michael Kors and J.Crew. In 2014, Ovington pivoted into an innovation role at sportswear giant Under Armour, where her mission was to look at new ways to enhance an athlete’s natural ability through performance apparel. While working with American Ballet Theater’s principal dancer Misty Copeland on her signature line, Ovington created collections that complement the female form and provide freedom of movement, ensuring the perfect balance between fashion and performance.

Tapping into my fashion and innovation background, we spent years obsessing over fit and quality, resulting in the GLOWE, a superior maternity legging I couldn’t go a day without wearing - and still don’t 2-months postpartum,” say’s Lucy.

Goat Organice Apparel,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Kidswear', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: Goat Organice Apparel DESCRIPTION: Founded by twins Abigail and Lavinia Bakker, the idea of Goat first appeared from their need for a basic white T-shirt. Although easy enough to find, it was a different story once they filtered it down to a white T-shirt that’s sustainable, organic and affordable. What to do when you can’t find what you’re looking for? They simply decided to do it themselves. “Sustainability is not sustainable if it’s not accessible” – That’s Goat’s motto. This means that the collections must be appealing, its source must be honest, the prices affordable and easy-to-purchase. Once all those boxes are ticked, the result is an ethically produced, 100% organic cotton T-shirt from as little as €17,95.

Over the years, the collections expanded beyond T-shirts. They added sweaters, longsleeve tees, joggers and, more recently, their REscued, REcolour, REmix and REcycle collection, always maintaining their ethical, sustainable and affordable DNA as strong backbones.

Gola has grown from humble beginnings to become an internationally recognised brand. Today, we have customers across the globe and are famous for our selection of trainers, plimsolls and bags. However, our brand has very humble beginnings and was born in 1905 in a small factory in central England. Soon, our shoe designs soared in popularity and we began expanding our range to suit changing trends and our customers’ demands.

Despite two World Wars and countless commercial competition, we continued to build on our knowledge and experience and before we knew it, Gola was the number one sportswear brand of the 1960s and ‘70s, and the go-to range for passionate fans and professional sportspeople.

We’re very proud of our roots and journey to the top. Some of our personal Gola highlights have to be the international craze that followed the launch of the Harrier in the late 1960s and the iconic Gola bag in the early 1970s. Throughout the 1970s, Gola was also seen on the pitches of major football clubs. Even to this day, we proudly combine British heritage with contemporary designs by merging original Gola styles with the latest trends.

It's fair to say that Gola has stood the test of time and made its mark on the fashion world and we’re happy to say that we’ve never lost that mindset of creating high-quality footwear and accessories for anyone who loves style and sport.",https://www.gola.co.uk,"{'neg': 0.006, 'neu': 0.858, 'pos': 0.136, 'compound': 0.985}",0.985,Positive,en

Gomaye,['Womenswear'],"BRAND: Gomaye DESCRIPTION: The history of Gomaye
Gomaye was founded in 2018 and is a Scandinavian brand that caters to stylish women who place high demands on quality and design. With deep roots in the dualism that arises between international currents and the Danish design tradition, Gomaye creates its collections. In the meeting between the two, what we call ""twisted classics"" arise, which are classic designs with a sophisticated edge. 

The mission of Gomaye
Gomaye's mission is to bring more reflection and elegance into women's wardrobe. We want to create designs where materials, textures, colours, and cuts can both interplay and be put together in new and unexpected ways, so styling becomes the deciding factor. Without the need to follow any trend, Gomaye caters to the woman who invests in clothes that she will love for more than one season. At the same time, each collection is a commentary on the currents of the time; every single element is created to elevate your look to a statement. Your Gomaye
Gomaye was created with style in mind. Gomaye's designs provide no definitive answer and can be combined indefinitely. Our styles provide space for your personal interpretation so you can express who you are.

A part of something bigger
Gomaye is part of an international fashion company that has 50 years behind it. Gomaye is a new and innovative brand that has grown out of an established brand house with a total of 15 brands. This means that Gomaye is part of a long Danish design tradition, with a focus on good craftsmanship. Anchored in an established and highly specialized fashion house means that Gomaye can offer designs of the highest quality with a perfected fit.

Our very own network of 1,500 fishermen collects ocean plastic as by-catch, which is then carefully separated and cleaned before processed. For each GOT BAG, we recover up to 9 lb of ocean plastic. The PET share of the recycled plastic is fed into our production chain, while all other unusable parts are discarded according to the right recycling chain. The raw material “ocean plastic” turns step by step into a high-quality yarn. Each production step conserves resources and follows the highest requirements for fair and social work conditions, including job safety and certifications.

Gramicci,"['Accessories', 'Bags', 'Kidswear', 'Menswear', 'Womenswear']","BRAND: Gramicci DESCRIPTION: Since 1982 Gramicci has been making functional clothing for life in the great outdoors. Built for movement, and loved by countless cultural movements—what started out in a garage in Ventura, California has travelled to the streets of Tokyo and beyond.

It all started in California in the 1970s, when a new generation of free-spirited rock- climbers known as the Stonemasters took residency at Yosemite National Park, pioneering a new way of climbing—with a strong focus on speed and style. These new methods required a new uniform, and whilst painter pants and army surplus gear worked to a point—flexibility was needed. Mike Graham, a Stonemaster with a keen eye for design, set about creating the first true climbing shorts. A diamond-shaped gusset found on a pair of kung-fu trousers was added to the crotch for full 180 degree flexibility, whilst hard-wearing canvas kept things sturdy when the going got tough. To keep the shorts fully secure, a nylon webbing belt was integrated into the waist. Taking cues from backpack straps, this cunning feature allowed the shorts to be adjusted with one hand, whilst the elasticated waistband kept things
comfortable.

In 1982, Gramicci was born—taking its name from a moniker Graham had given himself back when a few of the Stonemasters attempted the first ‘all-Italian’ ascent of Yosemite’s notorious Half-Dome (even though none of them were actually Italian). After the shorts came trousers—and word of these seemingly-indestructible pants—dubbed the G-Pants—soon spread. Their popularity wasn’t limited to rock climbers
either, and by the mid-80s a small contingent of surfers and skaters were seeking out these hard-wearing pants with the little hand-drawn ‘running man’ logo. Gramicci also found favour on the streets of Tokyo—and when time came for Gramicci to find a new home—Japan was the perfect place. Since then, Gramicci has continued to innovate and push new ideas, all the while retaining its original ethos. 40 years since
the first pair of Gramicci shorts were sewn together in Mike Graham’s garage, the song remains the same—it’s hard-wearing, functional clothing, designed with movement firmly in mind.

Grand Step Shoes,['Footwear'],"BRAND: Grand Step Shoes DESCRIPTION: If you want to make comfortable shoes, you have to know feet from the bottom up. Because perfect wearing comfort requires knowledge of the anatomy of the foot and the ability to choose the right materials.

Grand Step has this know-how - and more. The idea of ​​offering fashionable shoes with ecological standards has resulted in a successful brand with models for women, men and children since the early 1990s.

When designing our collections, we orientate ourselves on both classic silhouettes and current fashion, which we then translate into stylish, detailed and at the same time wearable models. In addition to having fun with fashion and creative design, we focus above all on sustainability. Because ecology and fashion are not mutually exclusive. We value ecological, natural materials, environmentally conscious handling and sustainable processing along the entire value chain, as well as fair working conditions and respectful interaction with one another. In addition, we reduce our CO2 balance in all processes through the shortest possible delivery routes and resource-saving means of transport. We are also working with our partners on projects to reduce water consumption in the manufacture of our shoes. 

Like our natural materials, we are not perfect either. But we work hard every day to constantly improve. We trust our partners and suppliers due to the long-term cooperation and are friends of an open and transparent manufacturing process. Nevertheless, we would like to give our customers even more security and are therefore planning to have further materials and factories certified in the future.

Granelito,['Kidswear'],"BRAND: Granelito DESCRIPTION: Granelito is the result of love and a passionate desire to create something unique. It all started when our founders, Moa and Miguel, met on a bench in Brooklyn, New York, in 2013. They had both left their previous jobs behind and were starting their first business of their own. Together with Natalie Joos, they started selling unused clothes from the 50s, 60s and 70s that came from Moa's grandparents' dead-stock from Eriksson's shoe and clothing store in Smålandsstenar.

Moa, an illustrator and designer, had always dreamed of using her creativity to the fullest and creating designs where colors were welcoming and vibrant. Miguel, born in Peru and with family in the Pima cotton business for over 40 years, felt it was natural to create baby and children's clothing with the soft Pima cotton fiber, something he had a strong connection to since childhood. In 2018, Granelito was founded in Brooklyn, where the couple lived until 2021 when they moved to Gothenburg. Granelito is a loving tribute to their roots and cultures, with Moa's Swedish and Miguel's Peruvian heritage at the heart of the company. By uniting their two worlds, they have created a unique fusion of Scandinavian elegance and Peruvian craftsmanship with a high quality in materials such as organic Pima cotton.

At Granelito, we believe in dressing children in clothes that promote movement and play while being functional for everyday life, including festive occasions. We value comfort without compromising on design, with a timelessly sophisticated aesthetic.

Our commitment to a sustainable and ethical manufacturing process is a given. Our commitment to our planet and its people permeates everything we do, from our choice of materials to our partners.

Granelito is part of our family and we welcome you to be part of our journey. Together, we can continue to create clothes that inspire creativity, spread awareness of our planet and allow children to be themselves.

With a collective work experience of over 35 years in the financial sector, they decided to give up their corporate careers to drive a change in the kids apparel industry. Deeply concerned about the health issues associated with the use of synthetic fabrics for kids clothing and the environmental impact of these fabrics, the two set out to produce high-quality, fun and vibrant kidswear using GOTS certified organic fabrics.

G-Shock,['Accessories'],"BRAND: G-Shock DESCRIPTION: Over 30 years ago, a CASIO engineer won the battle against the laws of nature. He designed a watch that would resist centrifugal and impact forces, as well as high water pressure. Since then, the name G-SHOCK has become a byword for independence and pushing the limits. G-SHOCK was developed at a time when watches were still fragile instruments. It all began with a young CASIO engineer who dreamed of ""designing a watch that would not break even when dropped"". 

After causing a stir back in 1974 with its first digital wristwatches, CASIO has had a significant influence on the watch market since the 1980s with the development of the virtually indestructible G-SHOCK wristwatch. The first G-SHOCK, the DW5000, came onto the market in 1983. An unparalleled success story followed as the G-SHOCK models, with their corners and edges, became an international favourite among urban youth.

The shock-proof G-SHOCK watches quickly became the epitome of robustness, innovation and multifunctionality. At last, enthusiasts could keep their wristwatches on while skateboarding or riding their BMX bikes. Falls and knocks are no problem for the G-SHOCK. Whether for everyday use, playing sport or under extreme outdoor conditions, G-SHOCK watches have been genuine all-rounders and reliable companions in every situation for almost 35 years. Today, G-SHOCK has earned the privilege of being worn by men who are not willing to accept limits.

If we still want to be here as a denim brand in 20, 50 or even 100 years from now, it is crucial for us to think innovatively about the impact we have on people and the planet.

For G-Star, this means future-proofing denim by investing in sustainable innovation and incorporating it in everything we do. We focus on a circular approach to how denim is made and used by our customer to create tomorrow's classics: quality denim of the future with respect for people & planet in a transparent manner.

The fundamental idea was to create sportswear of a unique cotton quality that would also have an extremely high degree of functionality and durability. 

Based on classic Scandinavian design, H2O Sportswear developed its own colourful and characteristic design with stripes, a unique fit and innovative designs. The collection was expanded during the 80's and 90's to include both swimwear, rainwear, and the popular sandals. Our collections are created around several themes focusing on woman lifestyle, men's lifestyle, swim & beach wear, bags and footwear. All products and collections are based on our core philosophy of producing everything in a unique quality with a high degree of functionality and a perfect fit.

Therefore, we constantly make extra efforts to ensure that we always/for all collections put together teams of the most successful and talented creative managers, designers, constructors, and specialists that can be found. Working on a foundation of H2O Sportswear's DNA and experience, this team ensures that we continue to develop our collections to achieve a fusion between sport and fashion that is suitable for the sports arena as well as for the urban environment.

Our design is based on the Scandinavian look with straight lines, colourful details, targeting the active consumer who wants clothes that can be used for a nice day on the lake, as well as a sunny day on the beach, or a day at the sports centre.
At the same time, we also want to challenge existing expectations by taking some of our iconic H2O products and ask some of today's outstanding Danish or foreign fashion designers to redefine them and create completely new, exciting and unique products. This focus started with our collaboration with the Danish designer Stine Goya, who made the very successful re-design of our sandals and has been followed by many other collabs with recognised designers such as Henrik Vibskov, Anne-Sofie Madsen, Mark Kenly Domino Tan, Freya Dalsjø and lately Han Kjøbenhavn and Oh! by Kopenhagen

Emil Otto, great-grandfather of the current managing director, quickly made a name for himself as a producer of high-quality cords and trimmings. Even then, our customers valued the natural materials and the precise processing in the best craftsmanship tradition. A short time later, the family business was making high-quality socks from first-class yarns. Emil Otto stepped outside the door of the ski lodge after a snack on a skiing holiday in Austria in exactly these socks. Of course, the snow soaked his socks immediately. This travel experience inspired Emil to equip the socks made of felted new wool with a robust leather sole. The result was not just dry and warm feet, but an innovative product. As a result, the success story of the hut shoe began in 1955.

The next slippers were quickly made in our family business, but at that time they did not find their way to the feet of customers under the name Haflinger. The company produced exclusively for well-known manufacturers who sold the slippers under their brands. These slippers became firmly established in the homes and hearts of slipper wearers around the world.

we never stop innovating.

#enhannce your inner beauty. You are precious! #hannjewelry HANN Jewelry is founded by Hannelore Vermeir.  

HANN Jewelry is made by hand with the highest precision and craftsmanship.  Being manufactured in Thailand, using the highest quality of silver, 925 or sterling silver; HANN  Jewelry will not cause irritation to the skin.  
The designs are inspired by nature, and finished with an emphasis on the smallest detail.  Furthermore will the collection be frequently updated to guarantee the exclusivity and authenticity  of your HANN Jewelry. 

Hannelore Vermeir travelled abroad to Thailand to practice her profession as the co-principal  clarinetist at the Thailand Philharmonic Orchestra since 2017.  
As a professional musician, Hannelore was always searching for modern, yet subtle and refined  jewelry, to add dynamic and class to the black concert clothing. Being very pleased with the  results of a local manufacturer, she decided to collaborate with the designers’ team, and to bring  the jewelry to Europe. 
After having worked in Thailand for a couple of years, Hannelore also noticed that her personality  became more hybrid, incorporating different aspects of both cultures.  
Consequently Hannelore would like to bring the romantic, intuitive and somewhat chaotic  tendencies of the Thai lifestyle, to the well-organized and ambitious civilization of Europe - as it is  known to her. The designs of the jewelry will reflect these ideas and form a bridge between the  two continents and their societies.

Happy Socks, a high-quality sock that combines unique designs and craftsmanship. (Probably) The world’s most comfortable and colorful tool for spreading happiness was born. This concept is now brought to life by Happy Socks’ talented team of creatives.

They didn’t stop there, their creative sparkle birthed two fashion orientated brand concepts, Hysteria and Dressed.

The idea was born and a lot of work started to solve that problem and make that dream come true.

None of us knew how to design leather products, source materials or even run a business. But our vision was clear and we have created more than just a couple of high quality products, we created a brand that we ourselves would be proud and happy to shop from. We have come a long way since then and will continue learning and striving to create products that are honest, functional, high quality and aesthetically down to earth.

A brand that crosses the generations. The small black jacket with a tartan lining appeared for the first time in the 60's in the famous US series 'Peyton Place'. The main actor Ryan O'Neal, who plays Rodney Harrington, wore this jacket in most episodes. At the time, it became the identifying mark of young members of the high society.
 
Later, the british Rock'n'roll movement rediscovered the Harrington jacket, and it became an iconic symbol of the Mods! These active urban youths were characterized by a festive lifestyle: they rode scooters, and were very style orientated and enjoyed music and dance.
The tartan signature lined garment has attracted many personalities through the generations: Steve McQueen, and Elvis Presley wore the Harrington Jacket, and later Noel and Liam Gallagher from Oasis and the actor Daniel Craig.
 
It's impossible not to recognize the Harrington jacket today at first sight with its tartan lining: this jacket is now a retro inspired wardrobe must-have.
 
Today, Harrington® is a registered trademark with its own eshop (www.harrington.fr/en/). The brand offers to shops and shops men's, women's and kids collections, with an absolutely English style but especially totally offbeat.

HARTFORD,,"BRAND: HARTFORD DESCRIPTION: Imagined by Yves Chareton in the United States in 1979, the Hartford project revisits American wardrobe classics, bringing them a twist of modernity. A decisive meeting was to launch the adventure, when a New York manufacturer sold him old stocks of Oxford and chambray fabric that were impossible to find on the market and which were ideal to make the first vintage-inspired Hartford shirts. The studio returned to Paris a few years later. The brand structured itself and began its commercial development: the collections grew in size and became synonymous with faultless materials and style.


By mixing European influences with a very west coast casual style, the brand quickly gained cult status on both sides of the Atlantic. It’s not surprising that Bruce Springsteen and Eric Clapton soon became unconditional fans…


Since then, the brand has kept pace with the times while preserving its cherished family values.

Born to generations of shoe manufacturers, our founder Daniel Rubin was destined to follow in their footsteps with a shoe empire of his own. In 1992 Dune London was born, beginning as a small concession store on London's iconic Oxford Street. The dream was simple - to create an affordable luxury footwear and accessories brand.

Our goal is simply to make a bag that instantly becomes your favourite. The bag you use day-in and day-out because it holds everything you need, right where you need it. The bag that expresses your unique sense of style without sacrificing your want for a bit of organization. The one bag you just can’t live without.

Hilana Upcycled Cotton,"['Accessories', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: Hilana Upcycled Cotton DESCRIPTION: We started our project three years ago, a bit by chance, a bit in search of a purpose that would fulfill us. We wanted to design daily-use objects made from solid waste, but we weren't sure where to start.
Pía, while on a city tour in Russia with his family, met a Mexican family, who was visiting Europe as well since the older brother had won a textile innovation award in Brussels, he was recycling textiles in his hometown.
Pía thought that this was more than a coincidence, and so it was since in 2 months she would move to Mexico City for work.
As soon as she landed in Mexico, she visited the textile recycling factory in Tlaxcala and saw the potential that this activity had. Pía called me to tell me everything she had seen and insisted that we should do something together. I had doubts at first, but after seeing the prototypes of Turkish towels, I couldn't resist.
Our first collection was a special project for a Chilean retail chain.The feedback was excellent so we decided to internationalize our brand in the US. But for that, we also had to move production to Turkey. This allowed us not only to improve quality but to expand the portfolio and increase volumes... And thus recycle more tons of cotton waste!
We traveled to Denizli to meet the artisans, led by a family dedicated to weaving for more than 30 years. Being linked to this artisan trade makes us want with all our hearts to keep it alive.
The journey has been as challenging as it is rewarding, full of learnings, mistakes, and achievements. Because while it is more difficult and expensive to start a triple impact business, in the long run, it is much more valuable.
Behind each of our products there's a story of sustainability, responsibility, culture and passion for the planet.

HIPANEMA,['Jewelry'],"BRAND: HIPANEMA DESCRIPTION: A French, bohemian-inspired brand, it was Hipanema's cuffs and Brazilian bracelets that initially got it noticed. In just a few years, this ethnic jewellery encrusted with beads, shells and quartz have become must-have pieces. Boosted by its success, the brand extended its range of items to also offer collections of fresh and colourful ready-to-wear and accessories. Hipanema was born in 2012, after an encounter that took place on Ipanema beach in Brazil. Jenny Collinet was production coordinator with Corpus Christi. Delphine Crech'riou was a designer for Paul & Joe, Castelbajac and A.P.C. The passion for fashion they shared meant they immediately hit it off and amongst many other points in common, they both loved the style of Brazilian bracelets that look amazing when a whole bunch are worn together. Back in France, the two women decided to adapt this trend to urban wear and created the Hipanema brand, adding a magnetic clasp to the bracelet, which could be changed to match different outfits. Their first collection was made up of eight cuffs, which came in a range of colours and materials - Bahia bands, leather, shells, beads and quartz stones. The bohemian aesthetic of the brand instantly won Parisians over, the infinite combinations of hand-made Hipanema bracelets became It accessories.

Following the success of their jewellery, the designers launched lines of ready-to-wear and beach accessories. Today, they are behind apparel with ethnic overtones, with finishings of beads, shells and sequins. As for the Hipanema bags, the tote bag with sparkling motifs has met with enormous success and the two designers love revisiting it with each new season.

Hipanema designs have brought a breath of exoticism to city-dwellers' wardrobes. The young brand has notably collaborated with L'Occitane to launch an exclusive necklace and a range of beauty products devoted to Brasil. Highly sought-after, it has also brought out a collection of ""poetic"" bracelets with Clarins, and bracelet watches with jeweller Poiray. With almost 1000 points of sale throughout the globe, Hipanema just keeps on growing. In Paris, it has inaugurated its first boutique in the Marais district. It has added coats, knitwear and printed trousers to its collections, as well as a line made up of fine gold-plated jewels inspired by the Far West.

We get our inspiration for our collections, by interpreting and creating the latest trends adapting them to our personality and values From design to last
The design is transferred to the last by expert hands. The process begins by adapting the design to the last using pencil paper and going on to use the latest technologies which are more effective in the scaling processes

Sharpening our knives
One of the oldest and most traditional processes in shoe manufacturing is the Leather Cutting . The ""cutters"" as the specialists working in this field are known work the large tanned leathers delivered from the specialist tanneries . From each of these large hides dozens of parts will be cut to make each one of our shoes.

Chain of craftsmanship
At Hispanitas we continue to use traditional methods and crafts in our manufacturing process, side by side with the state of the art technology. With the experience and skill of our artesans we are able to achieve a high degree of quality with every piece, material and finish.

The basis for your future footsteps
The insole and the heel are adapted to the last with infinite precision in order to ensure the correct balance with every step. To ensure that the sole is firmly joined, it is cleaned and prepared for application of the adhesive. Once joined, the heel is affixed along with the heel caps as at that moment the shoe can be removed from the last, and is ready for the final touches to be applied ready for the warehouse

Finishing touches
In order to ensure that each pair of shoes is perfect we take care with every little detail. The craftsmen use , presses, brushes and scissors to make the final touches to the shoes before they are packaged

HNST,['Denim'],"BRAND: HNST DESCRIPTION: Want to get to know HNST? 

HNST (read honest) is a Belgian circular clothing brand that produces jeans for men and women that have nothing to hide. With their jeans, HNST strives for the highest level of sustainability and circularity that is technically possible, without making compromises on quality and style. 

Since the most sustainable material is the one that already exists, HNST starts by collecting pre-loved jeans. The jeans will be sorted and is given a second life, when the quality is still sufficient, through the social economy. The remainder is HNST’s raw material and will be shredded into recycled cotton fibers which are later used to create the HNST denim fabric. This fabric eventually exists out 56% recycled cotton, 23% Greek cotton and 21% Tencel. The whole production process, from shredding to confection, takes place in Europe. But that’s not all. Due to the right partnerships and innovative production techniques, HNST is able to, per pair of jeans, reduce its water consumption with 95% and decrease its carbon emissions with 76%, compared to industry standards. For those who are into numbers, a pair of conventional jeans requires on average 7000liters of water when an HNST jeans only needs 361liters. However, every liter is one too many. That is why HNST continues to learn and research in order to attain a higher percentage of recycled cotton, less carbon emissions and lower their remaining water consumption. 

Most importantly, HNST makes sure that your jeans are designed to be timeless and circular. Unbelievable, but true, today less than 1% of material used to produce clothing is recycled into new clothing. In the case of jeans, elements such as metal rivets, buttons, zippers, fantasies, and polyester labels prevent them from being properly recycled. HNST is tackling this by applying embroidered instead of metal rivets, using unscrewable and reusable buttons, skipping polyester labels, printing all necessary information on the inner pockets, and by having back patches form FSC® and OEKO-TEX® certified Jacron paper. 

Ready to close the loop? Hand in your old HNST Jeans and you’ll get €15 discount on your next pair. 

There is a lot more to say about this brand, but most importantly; HNST makes jeans that don't compromise on style, sustainability, or quality.

HOKA ONE ONE,['Sportswear'],"BRAND: HOKA ONE ONE DESCRIPTION: Radical change often comes about in trying to solve a simple problem. Our original goal was to improve endurance race times by designing a shoe to go downhill faster. In doing so, we inadvertently reinvented the running shoe.

Our new shoes improved the experience of going uphill too. And down again. And up again. It turns out that redesigning a shoe that helps an athlete tackle 100 miles in challenging conditions can help all runners perform. While trail runners by night, our day jobs were in gravity sports. We had a hand in several snow sport and cycling innovations - including the parabolic ski - and everyday we asked ourselves the question, ""How do we go faster?"" When we imposed a form-follows-function discipline to designing a trail running shoe, we asked the same question. We answered it with a shoe that was met with ridicule by running shoe establishments, but embraced by runners. Those runners started winning races, and running shoe buyers started paying attention.

Our design ethos owes as much to surfing, skiing and cycling as running, and the patented elements we incorporated into the original shoe - aka the Hoka One One ® difference - influence every shoe we build.

Hol*Sh!t Shoes,['Footwear'],"BRAND: Hol*Sh!t Shoes DESCRIPTION: Our love for sandals started years ago when we discoverd the freedom of having sandals on our feet. Unfortunately, not everyone was charmed by this love. People made fun of us and called us names. We noticed sandals have some kind of weird reputation. But did we care about any of that? Of course not. 

In fact, we continued wearing our sandals and figured you should be able to wear them as well. On holidays, on rainy days. Whatever you like. Doing what you want to do, that’s total freedom to us.
When you invest in a pair of HolyShit sandals, you automatically become part of the Pigheaded People Club.
What this club offers you? Not more than a smile on your face ;)

Holzweiler,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Bodywear', 'Footwear', 'Swimwear', 'Bags', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Holzweiler DESCRIPTION: Holzweiler is a family business, Oslo-based fashion house founded in 2012 by siblings, Susanne & Andreas Holzweiler.

After running their own fashion agency for years, the siblings started their own brand in the spirit of curiosity and craftmanship, with the aim to make good fashion that can stand the test of time with design director Maria Skappel Holzweiler on board. Their very first collection was made of silk scarfs designed in collaboration with the famous Norwegian stencil and streetart artist, Martin Whatson. And in July 2014, Holzweiler expanded their creativity to the next level and launched a Ready-To-Wear line for both women and men.

The family’s strong passion for art, architecture, nature and contemporary culture, has resulted in numerous collaborations since then. Among others they have been collaborating with creatives such as Snöhetta architects, The Munch Museum, HBX Hong Kong, Poet Alexander Fallo, chef Hellstrøm, singer Emilie Nicolas, knit wear brand Skappel, yoga brand Run & Relax, Hotel Amerikalinjen, artist Ali Gallefoss, vegan movement Wild & The Moon and concept store Colette in Paris.

Today Holzweiler has grown to become an international fashion house with own flagship stores, leading retailers and prestigious department stores worldwide.

HOMEBOY,"['Accessories', 'Menswear', 'Womenswear']","BRAND: HOMEBOY DESCRIPTION: All this has a firm place in our soul until today. Homeboy was founded in 1988 as the world's third streetwear brand. 30 years ago streetwear was still original and stood for skatewear. The origin of Homeboy lay in skating, but already with the foundation the hand was reached out towards music.

The year 1988 is considered the break-out year of hip-hop. Cult bands like Public Enemy, Run-DMC, N.W.A. or Ice-T swirled up the scene not only musically but also fashionably. Homeboy sensitively picked up the vibes of rap culture and the mentality of the artists and formed them into fashionable originals. Already in 1989 the label equipped the German hip-hop legend Moses Pelham. In 1991 Die Fantastischen Vier were joined.

In the 80s, the first action sports took off into a future that forever shaped an entire generation of athletes. Skating was the origin of a ""coolness"" that had a lasting impact on fashion over the years and decades. The Skinny Jeans is the last achievement of the fashion, which it owes to the skaters.

In 1993, the Warped Tour combined skateboarding, snowboarding, surfing and music, sending a lifestyle into the world that has changed an entire generation. In the TEAM Homeboy were skateboarders, snowboarders, BMXers, Moto-Xers, surfers, wakeboarders and freeskiers. All this has a firm place in our soul until today.

Homer Avenue,"['Menswear', 'Womenswear']","BRAND: Homer Avenue DESCRIPTION: The Vision

Kathy Martinez is the designer and creative director behind HOMER AVENUE | the label, a distinct and unique womenswear inspired by art. Born in New York City, Kathy grew up loving fashion, art and design. Throughout her journey, art influenced her life and style. Art always stopped her on her tracks and that is what she envisioned for her collection, for people to stop and admire. Fashion has always found a way to borrow from art. The two have a symbiotic relationship where the one inspires the other. This relationship has been highlighted several times, for instance, when Gianni Versace's Spring 1991 collection featured outfits printed with Andy Warhol's brightly colored, silk-screened portraits of Marilyn Monroe, James Dean and other famous icon's. This is one of the times when fashion and art fuse, another one is when Kathy Martinez created HOMER AVENUE the label. When Kathy is not working on her visions for HOMER AVENUE | the label, she's enjoying time with family and friends in her Miami home. Kathy continuously draws inspiration for her clothing from art, travel, film and pop culture. To Kathy, HOMER AVENUE The Label is a celebration of her obsession for fashion, art and quality clothing.

High quality contributes to a longer life span for clothes, which is ultimately better for the environment. We do not need to destroy the earth’s recourses unnecessarily. Over the years, we have learned a lot about which fibers and production methods are better for the earth, and we still learn every day. Today, as the term “sustainability” is widely known and clearly defined, we need to collectively become more engaged and together make better choices.

Choosing materials and designs that are long-lasting yet kind to the earth, humans and animals are central to our business and brand.

For us, this is not only a trend but an important journey. It is an important part of who we are and what we do, it is a part of the Dagmar-DNA.

We wear our activewear every moment of the day, from our morning yoga to a coffee with friends, from afternoon meetings to  our evening run in the park.  

More and more people are living a conscious lifestyle and we see this influences fashion, as high heels and dresses are being swapped for athletic wear.
The House of Gravity woman leads a social & active lifestyle and is aware of the choices she makes in her life by taking care of her body, mind and soul.  She is consciously looking for gravity & balance between those elements for a happy and healthy lifestyle. Feel Your Inner Gravity   
We at House of Gravity believe that feeling our inner Gravity will support us in our busy and active life. A holistic & spiritual lifestyle isn’t a quick hype anymore and it is more than just a healthy food regime and exercising alone. It is a longing to re-connect and it is  growing among many of us. Due to our fast and digitised life we are always “on” and because of this, we are more in need of a balance between our body, mind & soul. When we check in with ourself, we connect with our intuition and we learn to listen and nurture what it is we need. We recognise that just as we fuel our mind, we must nurture our body, heart and soul. Making time for self-care is becoming increasingly important for our all-round happiness and health.  
A balanced life helps us to reconnect with ourselves to feel our inner Gravity.

In those days, skateboarding was simply not accepted: it was punk rock, it was hip-hop, it was a counterculture of outcasts misunderstood by the masses. It was a way of life that would ultimately shape Hufnagel's outlook on life. In 1992, Hufnagel moved to San Francisco to pursue his passion of skateboarding. He turned professional soon after, providing him a rare and rewarding opportunity to travel the world by means of his skateboard and the industry that supported him. Brought up by the very 'do-it-yourself' approach that came along with skateboarding, Hufnagel saw an opportunity to give back to that same community which had raised him, and opened a small boutique on an offbeat block of San Francisco's Tenderloin District, the first of its kind. Its aim: to bring together under one roof the most respected brands that the skateboard, streetwear, and sneaker communities had to offer. He named the shop HUF, and it quickly came to be recognized as the Bay Area's premier purveyor of hard-to-comeby goods.",https://www.hufworldwide.eu,"{'neg': 0.041, 'neu': 0.854, 'pos': 0.105, 'compound': 0.9297}",0.9297,Positive,en

The company is headquartered in Costa Mesa, California. Since 2002, Hurley has been owned by Nike, Inc. The history of Hurley traces its roots back to the surf industry in Southern California in the late 1970's. Hurley Surfboards was established in Costa Mesa in 1979. Well into the early 1980's, Hurley Surfboards was excelling as a company and Bob was shaping surfboards for many of the best surfers in the world. In 1982, Bob and his business manager, Joe K., began pursuing a hot Australian clothing brand, Billabong. Bob was attracted to the company because of their super long, punk rock boardshort styles. With the help of friends and family, Billabong USA was established as a separate entity and licensee for Billabong. By the end of 1998, it was clear that the team had it's own vision for the future that did not necessarily serve the interests of Billabong globally. Coincidentally, the license agreement between Hurley and Billabong was also up for renewal. With much gratitude, Bob and his team gave back the Billabong license and decided to launch Hurley.

From then, our office got busy. We sew 2.000 hats by ourselves one winter and realized we needed help. Today, HUTTEliHUT is produced in Denmark, Poland and even in the Bolivian highlands. Hats have been joined by dresses, daywear, baby suits, jackets and more - all designed with inspiration from the Scandinavian nature, in douched colors and simple motives. Kids all over the world, from Scandinavia and Germany to USA and China - are now dressed in HUTTEliHUT. Many things have changed since our journey took off in 2003. But most importantly things have not changed at all. We are still guided by quality and sustainability in everything we do. Our remarkable agents have stayed with us for many years. And even though our warehouse is much larger than the home office where it all began, we still aim to be very close to our customers.

Hvisk,"['Accessories', 'Bags']","BRAND: Hvisk DESCRIPTION: WHO ARE WE?
HVISK is a Danish fashion brand, based in Copenhagen. We specialize in designing playful and colorful bags. At HVISK we are a young team with creative minds and we are rapidly growing. We are constantly working on how we can be and do better – rethinking our design, optimizing our production and minimizing our impact on the environment. It’s important to us to keep developing new and more conscious ways of working to improve our products and our work in practice. WHAT DO WE DO?
Our ambition is to design bags that are playful, colorful and unique - made of high-quality materials. Every season we try to renew and challenge ourselves. We introduce new styles, new fabrics and new colors that combined tells a story. We get inspired by our vibrant surroundings in Copenhagen, and by other places that reflects the HVISK DNA. 

OUR RESPONSIBILLITY
As a fashion brand, we are aware that it is challenging to become 100% sustainable, but we feel that it is our responsibility to do our best to minimize our impact. 

Our first initiative was to become PETA certified as a vegan brand. We are committed to not using leather materials for our products, as we continue to explore new ways to produce and design. This is already embedded in our core, visions and values – and we strive to be transparent and honest in everything we do, so we maintain our status as an authentic brand.

Our second initiative was to start working with recycled materials. We always knew that we wanted to work with recycled materials and found that recycled nylon made for a great alternative to our nylon bag selection. The recycled nylon is made from bottles and other recycled plastic waste, all found and recycled in China, and the material has been inspected and assessed in accordance with the Global Recycled Standard. The Global Recycled Standard is an international standard that sets requirements for third-part certification of e.g. recycled content.

Our third and most recent initiative is an introduction to our new material, RESPONSIBLE. Our RESPONSIBLE material is a REACH certified PU. REACH is an EU regulation concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and restriction of Chemicals. This ensures high level protection for all human health and the environment, from production to end use. 
The PU used is a newly developed microfiber synthetic leather, which means the entire process has been changed in order to be approved as a REACH material. Not only does the material meet all standards of REACH, it is also four times stronger than regular PU, making the material extremely durable and the lifespan much longer. Our microfiber material uses a different softener at the end of production, making hand feel and grain appearance incredibly authentic when comparing it to real leather.

Ice Watch,['Jewelry'],"BRAND: Ice Watch DESCRIPTION: Ice-Watch is definitely worth 60 seconds of your time...

Time has never quite been the same since the arrival of Ice-Watch to the watch market in 2007. A watch whose colourful fashion-focussed and accessible concept would lead to an international, intergenerational and intercultural brand that’s ticking along nicely. Since then it has been constantly ticking away, changing and inventing new collections, with complete transparency. This value is conveyed by its name: ICE. Its stroke of daring – transforming a watch into a fashion accessory but a chic one at that – could have melted like ice in the sun. On the contrary, it has become one of the coolest successes on the planet. At a time when every minute counts, the Ice-Watch brand ensured its world domination by going out and getting the skills wherever they are. It was a matter of finding the right pace. Its limitless creativity is supported by talented designers based in Belgium and reliable Belgian services, the quality of Japanese movements (Miyota), Chinese expertise in production and assembly, and Hong Kong organisation for the logistics and distribution. It is said that a tree can be judged by its roots: they remain firmly planted in Belgium thanks to the efforts of the Ice-Watch brand’s founder and CEO, Jean-Pierre Lutgen. Marketing, communication, legal aspects and web campaigns are shared between Brussels and Bastogne, where the local presence was boosted in 2014 with the construction of a 6,000 m2 European storage centre. From one cog to the next, from solid teams to dynamic partners, from superb designers to committed distributors, the Ice-Watch brand has given itself the means to constantly grow its presence on an international scale.

As flexibility and responsiveness are encouraged at each level, it’s easy to understand how a simple idea could be transformed into a trendy accessory worn all around the world. Multiple styles: minimalist, sporty, urban, colourful, glamorous, romantic. Multiple materials: Ice-Ramic, silicone, metal, leather. Multiple audiences: men, women, kids and juniors. Multiple desires: 8 to 10 new collections per year, fitted with a screwed back, making them waterproof to 10 ATM. Collector’s models and more targeted models are released thanks to partnerships and prestigious co-branding arrangements (BMW Motorsport, Pantone Universe, Vendée Globe Race). The wide range of Ice-Watch timepieces can adapt to the lifestyle and activities of those who wear them. It’s more than a marketing strategy, it’s the commitment of a brand that’s a legitimate leader in its sector.

The Ice-Watch brand enjoys high visibility, whether on the wrist, in its ‘BeCubic’ presentation box, on social media (4,5 million Facebook fans) or through the vast network of Flagship Stores, Ice-Stores, kiosks and retail points of sale. Ice-Watch collections have generated many different product placements on the international music scene: Black Eyed Peas, Jennifer Lopez, David Guetta, etc.

Icon Eyewear,['Eyewear'],"BRAND: Icon Eyewear DESCRIPTION: Icon Eyewear (est. 1993)
At Icon Eyewear you will find the largest collection of Fashion sunglasses; Sports glasses and Blue Filter glasses available from stock.
- Choice of different POS models.
- Attractive affiliate program and online sales support.

It can be that simple.

Production:
Our original molds and glasses are produced in China. We have an office in Wenzhou that transfers all our production orders to carefully selected manufacturers by our colleagues there.
In this way we can set up and control the entire production process from start (raw materials) to finish (shipping to NL).
What does that mean?

Working Conditions:
Continuous monitoring of a safe working environment, compliance with the applicable Chinese working conditions and salary scales (no joke: they are now almost as strict as with us!).

Environment:
Controlled purchasing of “green” and, where possible, recycled raw materials. Phasing out of recycled plastic packaging (which you throw away after purchase) to “biodegradable” packaging. We are the first sunglasses manufacturer to do this! Checks on compliance with environmental legislation in China are stricter than ours: for example, every factory must purify its waste water before it is discharged into the sewer. Chemical and residual waste must be demonstrably safely removed and (re) processed.
Final result:
The production of glasses consists of 80% manual work: from continuous manual control of what is produced by machine to the assembly of the glasses and their final packaging. We take samples from each production run and test them in our own lab. As an extra check, we send random samples to an independent laboratory. They test the glasses against the current European quality standard.
The above of course has its price. Only if we want to pay a fair price to the manufacturer can we expect a product that meets our requirements.
And if we did not check everything ourselves, it is just possible that we would be cheaper for “the same” glasses.

Bremen is known for its town musicians. And it’s the place where igi was born in the year 2016.

We are a big family of 11 members including the father, the mother, the brothers, the sisters and the uncles. All 11 of us like seeing the world from a child’s perspective because children are mischievous, and curious about everything. In each collection, there is a story of a child in an igi member. Some are wondering what the animals are doing under the rain in Bremen, another is thinking of the outer space sitting by the Weser river. One is fascinated by the colors of the city walking in Schnoor. A historical district of Bremen, famous with its little old houses and narrow streets, while a couple is dreaming of a rabbit come out of a magic hat.

Our mascot is the Kiwi bird. Kiwi birds cannot fly. But this little bird knows that he doesn’t have to fly to be happy and enjoy life.

Kiwi shows us that it’s the journey that matters, not the destination.

Just like me and you, he collects memories on the road, and in every city he travels to.

Kiwi is in no hurry. He takes his time...

IKKS France,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Kidswear', 'Bags', 'Footwear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: IKKS France DESCRIPTION: Since 1999, the IKKS Women collection has been aimed at a woman with a natural and asserted femininity, always in search of new stylistic inspirations. At the heart of her urban-casual wardrobe, she favors authentic silhouettes, with ever-sought-after details. Want lightness. Want freedom. The new Ikks Women Winter 2017 collection signs a perfectly assumed urban casual allure. The brand reinterprets the trends of the season without ever compromising its DNA, by injecting it with the right dose of military, urban rock & denim spirits.

Urban adventurer, the Ikks woman adapts her style to suit her travels.
In which destinations does she find so much inspiration?
From Sofia to Brooklyn, via Nevada or New York, her wardrobe resembles her, instinctive and sassy. Quirky without being provocative, Ikks adopts a stylistic bias that shakes up fashion codes with assertive dualities. The hoodie slips under the leather biker jacket. The denim jacket, fully embroidered on the back, plays oversize on a long, fluid dress with a floral print. Deceptively wise, the velvet is gently needed in a top or blazer version. The classic poplin shirt is customized with guipure. The details are not left to chance, imbued with a remarkable femininity: butterfly sleeves, lace, satin, drapes and unstructured volumes.

The color palette is renewed around neutrals, off-white, black and heather gray. Plum and navy blue assert themselves in new blacks. More intense. More elegant. Brick red, emerald blue, powder pink, raspberry and saffron yellow add a twist to the looks. Khaki green, usually reserved for military pieces, is firmly in the spotlight, in a more bohemian interpretation, boosted by an offbeat neo-baroque print.

This winter, vaporous volumes and floral prints mingle with Ikks codes.
The materials play with relief and military details are omnipresent. The urban mixes with the casual. Chic becomes easy and style asserted.

Indosole,"['Footwear', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: Indosole DESCRIPTION: The idea of turning tires into soles came from the Indonesian people. Through ingenuity they, like many cultures around the world, managed to turn trash into something functional and new.

Each year 1.5 billion tires are being discarded worldwide. These tires never decompose and are a breeding ground for deadly diseases: dengue, malaria, and zika. Indosole has prevented over 100,000 tires from landfills and given them new life as soles for our footwear.

Indosole is a certified B Corporation. Certified B Corporations are businesses that meet the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability to balance profit and purpose. B Corps are accelerating a global culture shift to redefine success in business and build a more inclusive and sustainable economy. In 2004, founder Kyle Parson came into contact with billions of used car tires while travelling through Indonesia. Car tires are a breeding ground for deadly diseases and have a major impact on our environment. Indosole has found a better solution to this problem by recycling them and then using them as the basis for the outsole of all slippers. Indosole's mission is to inspire people to lead a more conscious life at every step they take. 

Indosole, has just launched a new collection, called “The Lost Sole”. Each year, millions of sneakers from major footwear manufacturers are produced in Indonesia, where the brand is based. There are always defects in the mass production of products. Those defects usually end up in landfill and even worse are being burned as a cheap source of fuel. Indosoles’ obligation was to adopt these LOST SOLES, preventing them from ending up in landfills and giving them a new life as soles. Using the same process in pulverizing our tires, we are now intercepting sneaker parts (from major footwear brands) and getting them on the streets as a fresh pair of Indosole sandals.

Using this unique natural panorama as inspiration, Lise Guitton and Mathilde Bon created Inouitoosh. Inouitoosh gets inspiration in la Baie de Somme, known as one of the most stunning bays in the world. Its unique landscapes, atmosphere and colour range make the identity of the brand very personal.

From this inspiration, a rich and dreamlike universe was born, with its mix of exotic touches and French elegance; each scarf is designed like a painting and tells a story. This year Inouitoosh becomes Inoui Editions, following the tradition of French textile and drawing publishers. At the intersection of enlightened modernity and extravagant classicism, our accessories are adaptable to everyone’s way of life in either hemisphere. Inoui Editions is inspired by the feeling we get looking out into the Somme bay from our old boathouse in Saint Valery. We bring this spirit to our first Parisian shop on Rue de l’Odéon, in the heart of a creative district dear to artists and makers of words and things. Inoui Editions’ designs stand at the crossroads of engraving and painting, and we create our figurative patterns to tell stories.

Since it was founded in 2003 by Wayne Edy, inov-8 has been renowned as a world leader in grip. The brand lives by the philosophy that an athletes’ interaction with the environment is the single most important factor when designing products. Our kit is light, fast and always innovative, as proven by our pioneering use of wonder-material graphene in sports footwear. Thanks to our agility as a brand we were able to beat other big sports companies to the use of our patent-pending graphene technology. We are the world’s first - and only - brand to use the wonder-material in sports shoes. We started working on the project in December 2016 with The University of Manchester, which homes The National Graphene Institute. The two scientists who first isolated graphene from graphite at the university in 2010 have since been awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics.
We never follow others, we carve our own way.

Iphoria was founded in 2012 by the Berlin-based designer Milena Jäckel, who has been convincing  and surprising over and over again with her special and euphoric product portfolio for eight years now. She has always captured the zeitgeist and fulfilled the wishes of today’s fashionistas.

Milena grew up in Lower Saxony, studied fashion design and international management. Already  during her studies, she noticed that the smartphone as a fashion-it-piece was still missed out. That's  how the idea of Iphoria matured. Today Iphoria has become one of the leading premium brands in the  field of Tech- Travel Gadgets. 

Starting with customizable cases and cosmetic bags to sneaker patches, a wide-ranging collection  was quickly developed, which now includes Sunglasses Cases, QI Chargers, Inflight Bags and  Cashmere. Today, the focus is set on the products that beautify and facilitate travel: From Lighting  Cables, Qi Chargers to Wireless Power Banks and Inflight Bags. The motto is: “I Never Travel Without  Iphoria”. With these functional products, there is nothing more to prevent of a spontaneous trip to  London or a beach holiday in Marrakech. 

Iphoria successfully launched its first cashmere collection in 2015. Not only Gigi Hadid was enthusiastic about this ready-to-wear collection, also 35 other countries are happy to represent Iphoria  in their area. Iphoria stands for euphoria in the digital age - for the certain 'je ne sais quoi', which  transforms the ordinary into a fashion statement.
 
Furthermore, Iphoria was twice awarded as ""Label To Watch"" by the “Textilwirtschaft”. Iphoria  continues to build on this success. 

The Iphoria trip has just begun and we look forward taking you along. Fasten your seatbelt!

With this simple idea in mind, we developed a new concept of footwear that keeps the material minimum enough to free your feet but protect them at the same time, just like a second skin. A pair of iGUANEYE is responsibly made in Portugal using only high-quality and ecological materials.

iGUANEYE is a minimalistic brand, both in the design and the low impact in the product life cycle. A pair of iGUANEYE is made to last. The main body of the iGUANEYE require no seams and no glue. After a long life and many miles, the shoes can be disassembled and the different parts sent to a common recycling bin. iGUANEYE is low-tech in its essence, offering a barefoot way of walking, not without some support and improved aesthetics. The technology, design, and materials are tested and certified being recommended by health professionals.

iGUANEYE is a pioneer brand founded by Olivier Taco. Olivier is a french designer. He moves to Portugal in 2013. After a first crowdfunding campaign to launch the project, he has been contacted by one of the biggest sole producer of Europe. Working as a designer for this supplier he was at the best spot top learn what was needed to design innovative footwear. It was also very practical to seek and find the best companies to craft all the different part involved. iGUANEYE is now working with five different companies. All in a 40km radius around Porto. This close relation is almost 10 years old now.

lrlandi,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear']","BRAND: lrlandi DESCRIPTION: A family story, of crafts, of passion. This is the story of Landi, an Italian factory with a long tradition. We are in the 40's, Italy had just gone out of war. These are the years of reconstruction, of the infinite possibilities for a country that can finally combine its innate talents with the opportunities, that the after-war years can offer. Tuscany is a territory of textile and sartorial antique manufacture, with specialized artisans and craftsmen. It's in this period of great ferment that, in 1948, Lando Landi found, in Empoli, the “Ditta Elios”, company specialized in the production of men's shirts. The attention to detail and the quality, are the focus of the company, the philosophy of Landi entrepreneurship. “To do what we are able to do in the best possible way"". 

This is what the founder was never tired to tell. Following this criteria, the company grew and developed, consolidating its own knowledge with constancy and evolving along the time. Born in 1956, created with passion and using the most advanced technologies, Landi's raincoat line is positioned on the high range of the market. The establishment is gradually structured according to modern layouts, optimizing the relationship between new technologies and crafts. 

The outerwear becomes the expression of the company's philosophy.  In 1984 , the historic “Ditta Elios” becomes Landi, functional structure to the development of new strategies. Since then, the second and third generation of the family continues in the mood imposed by the founder, with the same care and the same attention, absorbing the signals of the market and transforming them into products of quality able to satisfy the need of the most demanding clients. Today, the group is still on the market with three lines: Landi, Zerosettanta Studio and L'Impermeabile. Each  with a proper identity, and unique vision according to the family's sight.

IRON HEART,"['Menswear', 'Bodywear', 'Footwear', 'Bags', 'Jewelry', 'Accessories']","BRAND: IRON HEART DESCRIPTION: Iron Heart (WORKS INC)

Shinichi Haraki established The Works Inc and the Iron Heart brand in 2003. After 20 years of working in the garment industry in Japan, beginning as a pattern maker for Edwin and advancing to designer and producer/director for the company, he decided to combine his wealth of experience with his passion for motorbikes and create his own clothing brand, with a focus on heavyweight denims and durable fabrics, designed for and aimed at the Japanese motorcycling community. The Works Inc is based in Japan, with offices in Shibuya, central Tokyo and Hachioji, Haraki san's home town on the outskirts of Tokyo prefecture. There are Iron Heart stores in Tokyo, Osaka, and Kojima. Iron Heart International
In 2005 Giles Padmore was appointed by Haraki san to manage international sales, marketing and distribution. This close partnership which quickly became a firm friendship, coupled with the increased focus on the market outside of Japan, has generated a loyal following throughout the world. Our customers come from all walks of life, and many of them – but certainly not all – are bikers. The common factor is a love of ethically manufactured, beautiful and durable clothing. Giles and his wife, Paula, head up the international business from their base in Gosport, Hampshire, UK, which is now managed by their son, Alex, who leads a small, skilled team who are all passionate about the brand.

The Works Ethos
The Works creates classic and timeless clothing crafted out of the finest materials to the highest standards. This is not reproduction clothing; rather the study of classic denim and workwear styles and constructing them for today’s lifestyle. No attention is paid to fashion trends, nor that other jeans manufacturers have jumped onto the heavy denim bandwagon in the last few years. From the selection of the type of cotton used, to the weave of the denim, The Works is actively involved in the full garment lifecycle. This also includes designing and producing bespoke fabrics. The mills and workshops used are mostly small and family-run, whose deep pride in their products matches that of Works Inc.

Iron Heart Clothing
Iron Heart was originally made for bikers, and even today that focus guides design and construction of the clothing. Confident that the clothes appeal to a variety of owners, Haraki-san conceives of them to be worn by riders and for their preferences. Iron Heart garments are in the main made from heavyweight fabrics, designed to be durable, and to some extent protective for motor bikers. Iron Heart clothing is classic in materials and styling, using mostly flannels, denim and chambrays for shirts, and basing jackets on time tested military or riding favourites. Some designs – for example the 25oz XHS (extra heavy selvedge) denim jeans - are at the limit of what can actually be woven and sewn: “over-engineered is our starting point.”.

Our happy jackets are made from recycled plastic. In doing our thing, we keep a bit of plastic away from the dolphins.

The recycled plastic fabric we use is called RPET. RPET stands for recycled polyethylene terephthalate, or recycled PET. PET is a strong, durable and recyclable material that is used for single-use plastic soda & water bottles. We take old bottles and single-use plastic and turn it into fabric in order to reduce the amount of waste going into landfills and our oceans.

Our happy jackets are inspired & created all over the world & produced by an awesome team of caring & responsible manufacturing partners. We avoid using additional or newly-sourced plastic in any of our industrial procedures, such as production, manufacturing, shipping or distribution chains.

When you purchase an INSANE IN THE RAIN jacket you help reduce the unnecessary production of virgin plastic rain jacket fabric and simultaneously, upcycle from 17 to 23 plastic bottles that would otherwise roam our oceans. Also, your INSANE print helps by spreading awareness and getting the message out in the world to refuse single-use plastic.

At INSANE IN THE RAIN, we believe that we create our own reality & that together, we can make our reality a plastic free planet.

JAMES PERSE,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Bags', 'Footwear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: JAMES PERSE DESCRIPTION: James Perse was born in Los Angeles, California in 1972. James' childhood was split between the beach, the hockey rink and the floor of his father's innovative Los Angeles boutique, Maxfield. With Maxfield at the forefront of putting Los Angeles on the fashion map, James received an incidental education on cutting edge fashion from Europe and Asia, on modern architecture, furniture design and on the elegant and the clean-line. Ironically, sports led James to his first foray into fashion. Obsessed with baseball caps, he could never find one that was well designed - with quality construction, shape, fabric and coloring. In 1991, James set out to make the ideal cap for Maxfield and it was not long before customers became clients - film directors ordered hats for their cast and crew and record labels bought them for tours.

In 1994 he launched a t-shirt line that rapidly gained loyal fans looking for a seamless blend of luxe and casual. In 1996, James founded his first namesake collection of women's knits, which soon developed into two distinctly wearable collections; Standard James Perse for high-quality basics and James Perse Los Angeles ready-to-wear items, including jackets, sweaters, pants and dresses. In 1998, the brand launched an equally outlined men's collection and later, a line for babies and children.
His passion for minimalist architecture influenced by warm west-coast indoor outdoor living and the casual clothing that's inspired by it, ultimately resulted in James' personal design philosophy and aesthetic - low maintenance high fashion - emphasizing elegance and comfort, pairing sophistication with simplicity. James has applied this visionary approach in every step of defining and developing the brand.
In 2003, James Perse opened its first retail store. The retail environment acts as a medium for conveying the company's culture, ideas and values. James Perse is also available at top specialty retailers such as Barneys New York, Nordstrom and Saks Fifth Avenue and is sold internationally. James Perse launched its online shopping site in 2007 reaching a broader audience. Currently, a boutique hotel that captures the James Perse lifestyle is in development.

JAN 'N JUNE,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: JAN 'N JUNE DESCRIPTION: A bottle of wine, Hamburg, summer 2013. That‘s when we first had the idea to come up with an eco fashion label. It was a personal need. “Why is there no stylish, sustainable and affordable fashion label?”. We couldn’t find one.

And if you can’t stop thinking about it, you don’t stop working for it. We love fashion AND our planet. We don’t want the first harm the second. It took us over a year to actually start JAN ‘N JUNE. But the minute you’re in it – you’re in it. 150%. No excuses. Of course it wouldn’t have been us without some self-inflicted decisions to make things even more complicated. What can we say? Let’s start a business and build it up while living in three different countries. Nothing’s impossible.

So here we are now. A wonderful team of 15 talented and loyal people. Working together to create beautiful and minimalistic sustainable fashion. Tons of determination, ups and downs and little by little building our baby to make the world a tiny bit better – with some sustainable attitude and for sure with style. #byebyefastfashion

Each decision we take shapes tomorrow’s fashion. Jarod-Pi is a French brand with a specific message: curating quality clothes, faithful to our activist approach.

The brand’s mission is to dress without harming. Every day, we work to improve our production methods by conceiving products which respect all living things.

Human, Animal and Plant represent unique sources of life which must work together to flourish in harmony. This is why, from the conception to the making of our projects, each step takes part of a global goal and is far beyond individualism. Unique & exclusive
Today, fashion long ruled by the seasons, the globalization of the market and trends, is overtaken by ever-increasing demands and the implicit obligation to always produce more.

In response to this chaos, Jarod-Pi comes back to the source of the Art of clothing: almost tailor-made pieces, highlighted by their precious allure and their rarity.

Producing disposable clothing is an obsolete concept. To respond to the anti-waste concern, we have imagined a new way of consuming fashion: extra-limited quantities pieces produced on demand, whatever the year or the season.

To meet this commitment, we design models that will get through trends without ever failing to achieve their primary goal: to dress in style and allow everyone to express themselves through clothing.

Each day, Jarod-Pi attaches a great importance to evolve in the direction of progress and to be in symbiosis with its values. This is why, since the end of 2019, the brand has been manufacturing only in France. And for the sake of transparency and traceability, each item leaves our partner workshop stamped with a number proving that like you, our clothes are unique.

We create denim and ready-to-wear pieces with an emphasis on innovation and sustainability, and a keen awareness of the impact we have on the world at large. We are passionate in our belief that the person makes the outfit, not the other way around, and that passion drives us to constantly ideate, create, and innovate. J BRAND was originally founded in 2005 in Los Angeles, the original premium denim brand based in DTLA—the denim capital of the world. At the brand’s first fittings, the designers renounced the relaxed fit that was mainstream at the time, and the first true skinny jean was born. As the first denim company to introduce a skinny silhouette to the global market, J BRAND soon introduced other directional silhouettes and fabrications: the Maria high-rise skinny, Natasha, Carolina, our trademark Photo Ready denim—as well as its high-definition follow-up, Photo Ready HD—and the leather L8001, which has been a celebrity-loved staple since the brand’s inception. Today, these styles are the foundation of our DNA and are known as the permanent Icons. The debut men’s collection launched in 2008, and the first women’s ready-to-wear line came in Spring 2012, featuring luxe materials and a modern design sensibility.


J BRAND is offered worldwide at Net-A-Porter, MyTheresa.com, Selfridges, Harrod’s, Harvey Nichols, Bergdorf Goodman, Paris’ Printemps and Le Bon Marché, and Milan’s Biffi and Antonia, among others. Currently, the brand’s products are available in 56 countries the world over. Designer collaborators include Halpern, Kozaburo Akasaka, Bella Freud, Rob Pruitt, Simone Rocha, Proenza Schouler, and Christopher Kane.


The brand has collaborated with celebrities like Christy Turlington Burns—the star of our Spring 2020 campaign—Elsa Hosk, Cole and Dylan Sprouse, Kate Bosworth, and Stephanie Shepherd, whose exclusive design sold out in less than 24 hours. The brand's recent creative partnership with supermodel and brand ambassador Elsa Hosk realized a sustainably minded capsule collection of forward denim and leath​er pieces that are beloved by the VIP set globally.

The designers are particularly attentive to the use of noble materials such as wool, cotton, silk and cashmere. Victoria Eaton joined her parents in September 2013, full of great energy and creativity she is now the shock & charm asset of this well establish team.

At its core is a fusion of classic tailoring and vintage glamour, reinvented for today’s woman. Clean lines, supreme quality and complex construction are central to its design mission. Infinitely wearable, yet as unique and iconic as a work of art, these statement-making pieces are for the confident, creative and courageous.

The collection is a fusion of bold silhouettes, rich color and luxurious fabrics with a distinct “edginess”. Like all Jennifer Ritz designs, each piece is engineered to flatter the female form and designed specifically for her muse: the woman who knows who she is and what she wants, who inherently possesses a strong sense of personal style and effortless chic, and who can’t help but turn heads every time she makes an entrance.

The Fashion industry no longer resides in creation of luxurious fabrics with cutting edge designs but is considering the new revolutionary road for extraordinary materials. It is one of our most important goals to allow every individual to express their identity by offering unique fabrics and designs that can translate into every style. At Jettru, we are concentrating on natural fabrics, such as silk and are also turning by-products into surprising new fabrics made from i.e. milk, oranges or even recycled plastic. We combine timeless designs and the future of fashion for a more conscious and aware generation. We offer garments that are healthy to wear and revolutionary to buy. We envision a new life for these materials, transforming them into refined, ethereal clothes perfectly suited for luxurious fashion statements. Jettru is modernity and innovation alongside reference to the world of street fashion. All our dresses can easily transition from the office to your favorite bar, so that you don’t have to rush home after work to change. Wether you pair our styles with a plain T- Shirt or a sharp blouse, everything will fit and flatter your body.

jitrois.,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear']","BRAND: jitrois. DESCRIPTION: Born in Narbonne, Jean-Claude spent his childhood in Aix-en-Provence surrounded by his mother, a housewife, and his father, an aviation officer. At the age of 18, he moved to Paris to study child psychomotor skills at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital. He follows the courses of major psychoanalyst amongst them Françoise Dolto and Jacques Lacan. The abrupt move to fashion happened after Jean-Claude began exploring Jacob Moreno’s theory of therapeutic psychodrama. This theory was applied when treating children with learning difficulties, dressing them in handmade costumes to help them feel more comfortable in their own skin.

In 1968 he graduated and transferred to Nice. To help the children in his care and restore their confidence, he creates “therapeutic” disguises in crepe paper. In 1975, he became director of the Higher Institute for Psychomotor Rehabilitation in Nice and was involved in the training of nearly 400 students. In 2002, Jean Claude Jitrois received the Legion of Honor for his contribution to the Fashion sector and the promotion of France throughout the world. The JITROIS HOUSE
New. Subversive. Luxury.

In the Age where life has been enhanced through social networks and the digital revolution – jitrois has adapted and developed. The brand has explored the relationship between the skin, the leather and the digital. In the world of webcams, instant messaging and permanent connectivity
the concept of a second skin has been applied to the entire virtual body symbolising a renewal of interaction.
Jitrois. endeavours to retain its eponymous image of high luxury but merged with subversive youth culture. Today the house creates powerful and confrontational pieces that program a new path for desire, either physical or virtual; but, never conforming to social codes.

JJ Footwear,['Footwear'],"BRAND: JJ Footwear DESCRIPTION: JJ Footwear knows that every woman is unique. You too! Every foot and every calf is different. Buying boots and shoes is not always easy. JJ Footwear offers the solution. As a fit specialist, we offer fashionable boots with a wide shaft, boots with a narrow shaft and boots with a regular shaft. JJ Footwear offers normal and wide ankle boots and normal and wide shoes. Our entire collections are equipped with flexible, non-slip soles and removable footbeds. No less than 70% of European women have problems buying shoes and boots. The development of a calf boot in various widths solved a large number of consumer problems. Your feedback has taught us that not only the calf width is a problem. Other parts, such as the length and width of the foot, are also important to guarantee an ultimate fit. The solution was simple; Just as you have ready-to-wear sizes with clothing, we developed that for boots (and later also shoes and ankle boots).

Today, JJ Footwear has developed a unique system in which four crucial measurement points are included in the final design. This concerns the instep width, the forefoot circumference, the ankle circumference and the calf width. JJ Footwear has the most comfortable and perfectly fitting range of boots with a normal shaft, boots with a wide shaft, boots with a narrow shaft, normal ankle boots, wide ankle boots, normal shoes, wide shoes, normal pumps, wide pumps, sandals and slippers.

John Hatter & Co.,['Accessories'],"BRAND: John Hatter & Co. DESCRIPTION: John Hatter & Co. is an exclusive Swedish fashion brand founded in 2018, creating luxury caps carrying bold, iconic and disruptive statements. Inspired by the classic trucker cap, John Hatter takes some of the world’s most famous quotes and phrases, prints them on a miniature aluminium embossed licence plate and puts it all together to form a premium cap brand which is impossible to ignore – whether you love or hate it.

The brand was created by former investment banker John Carlstrom and his old racing buddy and former Swedish TV personality Mats “MK” Karlsson. Today, they are the foundation of John Hatter & Co.

After months on sampling, going through dozens of factories, carefully considering the quality of all the materials that go into making a premium cap, the duo’s focussed approach and obsession, helped to create the perfect model and fit so that John Hatter & Co. caps would have the ultimate classic appeal.

Both headquarters and showroom are located in Stockholm with the warehouse located a quick 20-minute drive outside the city. All orders are supervised from Sweden and we proudly ship all orders within 24 hours of ordering.

John Henric,"['Menswear', 'Bags', 'Accessories']","BRAND: John Henric DESCRIPTION: John Henric was founded in 2008 in the historical city of Lund in Sweden, back in the days John Henric produced high quality accessories for high-end fashion boutiques. Later John Henric branched out and started producing shirts, sweater and bags, which made the brand well known. Two friends had a vision: to spread and highlighting male accessories by turning everyday essentials into details that would make all the difference with a rigid standard of quality, craftsmanship and creativity. 

A concept now brought to perfection. Today John Henric products are sold all over the globe and features an almost endless variety of designs and fabrics. We love the Italian way of life and if you look close you can feel the soft mix between the Swedish and Italian way of designing fashion. We know that to be irreplaceable we must always be different and create our own world of accessories shirts and sweaters. Our desire to create high quality affordable luxury products without middle hands has made us experts on adapting the company for our customer's needs in the shortest time possible. All thanks to our vertical integration – from design to manufacturing to retail. 

Unlike traditional fashion companies that purchase their clothes from suppliers, John Henric collaborates with small and often family-owned manufactures. This helps us to manage our inventory with extreme efficiency. It also allows us to respond to seasonal and fashion changes very quickly. We can now offer high quality accessories and shirts without wholesale, which means we can offer our customers great prices and quality.

Johnnylove,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear']","BRAND: Johnnylove DESCRIPTION: JOHNNYLOVE was launched in 2006. How was the brand conceived?

Some years down the road from when I tailored my first clothes – and after launching my first brand in the late nineties, a futuristic and minimalistic collection under the name Zaishi – I felt ready to go all in, creating what should be my legacy. The starting point for JOHNNYLOVE was that Norwegian men in the early 2000s either dressed very loose and casual, or very updressed or formal. Most men weren’t good at combining clothes to be more presentable but still casual. I wanted to create a line of clothes that would make it easy for a man to build a wardrobe that would make him a bit more updressed without crossing the line to formal wear. Clothes that you could wear at work and still not have to change before going out at night, say, if you got a spontaneous invitation to a party.
Also, i didn’t want to present very conservative clothes, but something that was a bit playful and elegant at the same time. At the time a lot of my friends and early customers were band members or part of the local emerging music scene, and I guess the rock esthetic is present in JOHNNYLOVE’s dna because of that. I remember as we all grew older, my friends needed something else than Converse all stars and saggy jeans; There was a need for grown up clothes with an unconventional attitude.

I think “making men dress up in daily life” sums up my vision. Updressed means something specific in my mind of course, regarding materials, cuts and detailing, that goes into that vision.

Jonak,['Footwear'],"BRAND: Jonak DESCRIPTION: Far beyond simple shoes, Jonak is above all the story of freedom, the playground of creation and the love of transmission.
This story begins in 1964, in Paris, rue Saint-Placide, when Marcel and Josette Nakam opened their first shoe store. At the time, everything was possible, society, fashion, art, upheavals, revolution, the desire to believe in it, it was the Sixties. And already, in Saint-Germain-des-Prés, a vision, that of a job well done, of a taste for beauty and sincerity.

Alongside Marcel, in the little shop at 26, his wife Josette, who stands out for her elegance and strength, and his son Joseph, who does not yet know that he will build, one stone after another and like a obviously, one of the big names in French footwear. By forming the name “Jonak”, a fusion of their first name and the surname Nakam, Marcel seals the fate: Jonak is and will remain a family adventure. “Because the foot is the basis of the building of the human body and the human without the woman is nothing, the years have not dulled my passion for shoes. »
Joseph Nakam

Choosing Jonak is above all joining a great family story. The history of the Nakam family on the one hand, which for 55 years has held the reins of the brand. But also that of our employees and partners with whom we have always worked hand in hand.

From the beginnings of the development of its shoes, Jonak chose to produce in Europe and more precisely where the know-how would make it possible to make its models in short circuit and in the rules of the art: in Portugal. Italy and Spain, also famous for the manufacture of shoes, complete the production. The excellence of the materials, the mastery of the gesture as well as the rigor of the technique are the key words in the making of Jonak pieces. By combining production precision and correctness of proposal, we present a constantly reinvented offer, at the right price throughout the year.",https://www.jonak-paris.com,"{'neg': 0.005, 'neu': 0.871, 'pos': 0.124, 'compound': 0.9891}",0.9891,Positive,en

Our founder is Harold van der Mark, who was tough enough to take his independent women's fashion store to the next level and start his own brand; Josephine & Co. Named after his parents (how sweet is that) and destined to dress the confident, modern, stylish and fashion loving women of this planet. Right. You. Because you fit that description, right?

Here we are. On your desktop / tablet / smartphone. How did we end up here? We are proud Dutch, started in Utrecht fulfilling the wishes - and filling the wardrobe - of women who didn't feel like choosing between stylish or sporty, and who prefer to dress in a tight mix of both. We grew slowly but surely, and when the time was right we moved the collection & office to Driebergen. But the city was still in our blood, we live and breathe urban cool. Driven by ambition and a growing fan base, we spread our wings a little wider and landed in our current nest or head office, located in Amsterdam.

JOSH V,"['Womenswear', 'Bags', 'Accessories']","BRAND: JOSH V DESCRIPTION: The Dutch fashion and lifestyle brand JOSH V by fashion designer Josh Veldhuizen is known for stylish and elegant collections that make women’s hearts worldwide skip a beat.

JOSH V creates highly accessible yet still luxurious, ready-to-wear collections which belong in the wardrobe of any self-aware woman that wants to cut a stylish figure.

“I want to make women look and feel spectacular.”
- Josh Veldhuizen JOSH V was founded in 2011 by fashion entrepreneur Josh Veldhuizen, born and bred in Amsterdam. In only a few short years, she managed to turn the brand into a prominent fashion label using her passion for fashion, entrepreneurial spirit and a lot of hard work. JOSH V is now one of the fastest growing fashion brands in Europe. The label is known for its signature luxurious style and premium quality, highly feminine collections featuring unique finishes.

Josh Veldhuizen is from an entrepreneurial family and had a successful modelling career at a young age. She travelled all over the world for photo shoots and met dozens of leading fashion designers, international stars and trendsetting it-girls. As a columnist for several fashion magazines and as a blogger, she shared her travel experiences and her adventures in the fast-paced world of fashion and lifestyle with the world.

Josh’s affinity for fashion and her ambition for starting her own business inspired her to create fashion label JOSH V: a brand with an extraordinarily chic and fashionable image that was sorely lacking in the Dutch fashion market. At the same time, Josh envisioned and realised her own reality TV show, in which RTL5 followed her during the preparations for and launch of the first JOSH V collection. The show resulted in nationwide publicity for JOSH V.

These days, JOSH V is sold in over 400 partner stores, and the JOSH V collections are available in eight different countries apart from the Netherlands, including Belgium, Germany and Portugal. Moreover, JOSH V items are sold worldwide from the official web shop at JOSHV.com.",https://www.joshv.com,"{'neg': 0.01, 'neu': 0.897, 'pos': 0.093, 'compound': 0.9741}",0.9741,Positive,en

JULIA LEIFERT,"['Womenswear', 'Accessories', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: JULIA LEIFERT DESCRIPTION: Born and raised in southern Germany, passionate vegetarian and animal lover, the designer Julia Leifert dealt with the topics of sustainability and environmental awareness early on. Her first steps as a designer began when she designed and made her own clothes as a teenager.

After graduating from high school, she went to Lake Constance to study law, but never lost sight of her passion for fashion and art. After graduation, she moved to New York City and Berlin, where she studied fashion and design management.
Even before the tragic collapse of the Rana Plaza building that would shake the world in 2013, she knew that she wanted to change working conditions in the fashion industry and that for her, women's empowerment, equality and holistic environmental awareness were inextricably linked to fashion.
connected with fashion. So in 2014, while studying, she founded the ""project"" JULIA LEIFERT. The demand for a holistic sustainable alternative to conventional fashion, as well as the attention of magazines such as Vogue, Harpers Bazaar and L'officiel was not long in coming, so that the project grew into a company that in recent years has increasingly won awards, shows designs at international fashion shows and distributes worldwide.

Today, Julia Leifert stands for award-winning fashion design, handmade pieces that focus on localism and social requirements, transparency and comprehensive ecological aspects as part of fashion. THE MISSION of Julia Leifert is to empower women through and in fashion and to inspire and raise awareness that fair and regional production, animal welfare, the preservation and careful use of our resources and traditional craftsmanship are not only possible but a fundamental part of fashion and that the concept of luxury needs to and can be to redefined. In times of uncertainty, exploitation and environmental destruction, it is more important than ever to take responsibility and raise the voice and power of women for more EQUALITY.

""I design fashion for independent femininity, for women who dare to show themselves and follow their passion. We as women have a lot to say and need to be heard more in society. I want to inspire women to be brave. Not only as a women lead company it is important to us to see more diversity in the corporate culture and I want to encourage women to stand up for their dreams. Because we all are loving, beautiful, brave and stunning. Just as we are. It is time to show this grace to the world.""

Warm-hearted people, tropical weather, impressive natural spectacles - the Bali vibe directly captivated the two.

This is how they came up with the idea to create pieces of jewelry from the highest quality materials and to design and manufacture them in their own manufactory in Bali, so that the jewelry radiates the positive, Balinese attitude towards life.

Over the seasons, curl up in a stole, bundle up in cashmere, which on summer evenings keeps its place on the terrace. Protect yourself in a fabric that looks like us, that we make our own. This is how July to June was born.

Since our youngest age, we run in the alleys “at the end of the world”, we bask in the “sunset dead end”, we hide in the “rue du Puits Doux”, and it is therefore quite natural that we wanted to weave and anchor the story of July to June on these shores that we love so much and which resemble us so much. It is in this village at the end of the Ile de Ré that the adventure began for us a few years ago.

Coming from a family of artisan couturiers, fabric merchants, we wish to perpetuate this know-how while developing our methods in the era of time. This long family tradition allows us to benefit from privileged relations with the largest sericulturalists, weavers and producers encountered in India for a very long time. We take special care in the manufacture of our fabrics, aware that we are part of a human approach and a local ecosystem.

It is a universe that will make you want to escape with its different materials and colors. Because it is indeed a brand that will help you through its patterns and its plain colors, to live the different moments of your life and the seasons.

So make way for noble and worked materials, subtle colors in order to weave cozy atmospheres in which everyone, man and woman, can take refuge. Let our desires unite with the world of July to June to find comfort, a sweetness, an identity all of our own.

Wool stole, cotton or silk scarf ... graphic print, solid color, July to June's selection is chic and timeless.

You will see once adopted, we never part with it. A true new institution of the headscarf and scarf, July to June will be present in all moments of your life.

Jupe by Jackie,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Kidswear']","BRAND: Jupe by Jackie DESCRIPTION: Based in the Netherlands and India's Uttar Pradesh, Jupe by Jackie is an internationally renowned fashion brand born out of a desire to shine light on the art of hand embroidery in a completely novel way. Revitalising a dying craft in today’s fast-paced fashion industry, Jupe continues to make its mark as leading embroidery house as it strives to let Indian artisanship not only live, but thrive. Jupe by Jackie can be found in high-end boutiques around the world, such as Merci, Song and United Arrows. From 2013 to 2017 the brand collaborated intensively with Comme des Garçons.

Designer Jackie Villevoye established Jupe in 2010 at age 54, after having raised her five children. When they left home, Jackie’s lifelong enthusiasm for design became even more determined: having extensively studied the craft of Indian hand embroidery, Jackie embarked on a journey that led her to a highly talented team of embroidery craftsmen. A passionate collaboration was born.

Jackie’s main goal became, and still is, to draw attention to this impeccable art, passed down from generation to generation - giving Indian hand embroiderers the worldwide recognition they deserve.

Challenging the typical career paths women are advised to take, Jackie’s own life story can be reckoned as a true inspiration as well: having proven that regardless of age, you can always pursue new life purposes and achieve great success along the way.",https://www.jupebyjackie.com,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.773, 'pos': 0.227, 'compound': 0.9962}",0.9962,Positive,en

Just In Case,['Womenswear'],"BRAND: Just In Case DESCRIPTION: ABOUT JUST IN CASE

Just in Case is an Antwerp-based womenswear label that was founded in 1999 and is well known for its tribute to romance and curtsy to sensuality. The collection allows women to be bold and dashing. The story of Just in Case started when two women met on a bus. It took a few years for them to notice that they actually were spiritual twins. 

When beauty is determined by the beholder, the details will constitute the soul of the work from Vicky Vink and Katrien Strijbol. Their vision on fashion is playful and their intuition for it unparalleled. Look at Just in Case as if it was an old book full of stories, handed down from generation to generation. With images that will reveal itselves when the timing is right. Behind every detail there’s a story, together they make a bigger story. In the end it turns out to be even more substantial than initially expected. Every chapter is placed into its own environment. And just when you think you’ve seen it all, another hidden door appears.

Justine B,['Womenswear'],"BRAND: Justine B DESCRIPTION: Artist at heart, it was at the age of 12 that I knew I wanted to work in fashion.
And it was with my mother, who made her own clothes, that I discovered the love of sewing and beautiful fabrics.
After four years of studies in fashion and a year of work in children's fashion, I decided to make my childhood dream come true.
This is the birth of Justine B. My work in children's fashion (in the quality department) really made me aware of the terrible hidden underbelly of fashion.
And it is to meet the desires of many of us towards more naturalness and healthy products that I decided to create my brand.

The clothes are thought out and created with care in my little Parisian workshop.
The quality of the fabrics being essential, I chose to source from French GOTS certified suppliers who mainly manufacture in France or in Europe.

In addition to wanting a brand that is as ethical as possible, I want to meet the needs of women today.
Because the ideal size does not exist, the garment can be personalized (longer / shorter, fitted / loose ...)

KAAI,"['Bags', 'Accessories']","BRAND: KAAI DESCRIPTION: How it all started

KAAI was founded in 2017 in Antwerp, Belgium, by Ine Verhaert and Helga Meersmans who set out to reimagine the perfect work-life bag for the eclectic woman with exquisite style standards.
Before, the duo spent a lot of time travelling around the world. Rushing from one meeting to the next during their corporate careers. They're main companions: a laptop, a mobile phone, lots of paperwork, and women’s essentials, all stuffed into their handbags.

Desperately looking for a stylish bag to complement their active lifestyles, they knew they could do better. So they got a handle (pun intended) on their idea: creating a new bag concept for women on the go.
Capturing the ongoing energy of the city and the ever-moving water of Antwerp, KAAI (meaning ‘the quay’ in Dutch) symbolises the fluidity of modern women, going places.

By women, for women
We take inspiration from the lives and desires of successful modern women.

From in-depth interviews with active women, discussing their relationships with their bags we discovered that women are:
‣ irritated by the chaos in their fashionable but often impractical handbags,
‣ bored with the masculine looks of their workbags.

KAAI brings change by creating bags that are both functional and fashionable, feminine and fearless.

We empower women to follow their ambitions. On their terms —without compromises. Sophisticated simplicity
Drawing inspiration from the colours and pure graphic lines of Art Deco, we reinterpret this era’s timeless allure into magically modern, minimalist handbags with forever appeal.

Both contemporary and utterly covetable, we design for a variety of occasions. From casual to formal, from day to night.
Handcrafted to the highest standards, all our products are refined and reliable. That uncompromising commitment to quality and exceptional attention to details and textures are at the heart of everything we do. We source only the finest, most enduring materials . Our collection is made of Italian leather, treated with an innovative technology which makes it resistant to scratches, water and sun rays, to create bags that survive the daily grind. The luxury interior of our bags is lined with velvet suede in the signature KAAI blue to protect everything women place inside.

KABAK,"['Bodywear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: KABAK DESCRIPTION: KABAK has its roots in Poland, a country with a beautiful textile industry’s history. Since 2013, we design and create fashion accessories, sustaining local traditions in harmony with nature and transparency to our customers. 

We started our adventure with the colorful socks and successively developed by widening our offer with beanies, scarves, belts, and other unusual accessories. In 2021 we created a KABAK Home Collection where you can find cotton blankets, soy wax candles, bath towels and posters. The deep care for the quality of our products was possible thanks to the Polish manufacture and Kasia - our designer whose artistic soul made KABAK possible. From the very beginning, the goal was to create an alternative for popular chains and offer something sustainable that doesn’t have a bad influence on the environment. That’s why all products at KABAK are 100% vegan. We constantly search for solutions, discovering the hope for a new future. Our brand introduced recycled materials and organic cotton to its collection and clearly set the goals around the idea of less waste and sustainability. Paper products that we use for labels are all made of crush or kraft - papers that need only organic waste or recycled materials to be created.

The sustainable brand does not focus only on sustainable products. That’s why we take a step further and try to do something for our community wherever we are. KABAK team is a group of family and friends. We like to treat our customers like that as well. We integrate and cooperate on various surfaces.  KABAK collections contain those made as a collaboration with local artists, charity, and animal recovery centers. 

The simplicity of the KABAK products makes them universal and  right for everyone. Whether you love bright colors or stick to minimalism, socks, beanies and other KABAK collections fit absolutely every outfit and personality. That makes them a perfect idea for a gift. For those who need something more personal, we offer customized orders.

They cost a fortune, had a short lifespan, were poorly designed, and lacked essential functionality. They were not produced sustainably either. We decided to do something about this. And so KAOS was established.

With a strong commitment to creating better products and with great respect for the planet and the environment, we established KAOS in 2014. We originate from communication, design, and digital branding, and we launched our own online store and our first product, the KAOS Ransel, in 2015. 

The first batch of bags was delivered in the garage facility under our apartment. Our first “warehouse” was our living room, and we packed orders in the evening after our “real job” had been overcome over and the kids were put to bed. With babies in our arms, we were in the middle of our own target group. All the products we have developed have come from a real need we’ve had as parents, and with an undeniable urge to change an industry for the better.

The meeting with Anthony Birgin, designer and craftsman, marks the beginning of a flourishing partnership. His original jeans, in tune with the times and at low prices, are very popular with young people. The feminine line is called Miss Mc LEM and the masculine line Mc LEM JEANS. In 1991, the Marseille basin was shaken by increased competition from Chinese production. Mc LEM does not escape this twist of fate. The family sells its wholesaler activity and converts into the DENIM web. In 1993, Mc LEM refocused the company's activity in the production of canvas from Morocco. Faithful to its values, to the integrity and the requirement which forged its reputation, it recreates on the other side of the Mediterranean, with new partners, the authentic spirit of Marseille textiles and then renews with success. The beginning of the 2000s was marked by the reign of the Italian jeanneurs who imposed their style with low-waisted cuts and the trend of fading and pieces sold for nearly 200 euros.

Today this logo symbolizes the mutual fairness and recognition of men and women in sport and in everyday challenges. As a global sports fashion brand, Kappa advocates this positive attitude, which is communicated with the slogan “Stay sporty” or “be a good sport”.

Sponsorship began in the late 1970s and Kappa reacted quickly. For Juventus Turin, Kappa becomes the first ever sponsor of an Italian soccer team. Technical sponsorships for other successful clubs soon followed: AC Milan, FC Barcelona, ​​AS Roma and Ajax Amsterdam - they are all winners of the most important club cups in Europe. In 1981 Kappa became one of the main sponsors of the New York Marathon, from 1983 a 10-year liaison with the US athlete began, at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles and 1988 in Seoul and at the Goodwill Games in 1986 and 1990 in Moscow and Seattle Fought for fame and honor in Kappa clothing and shoes. Top athletes such as Carl Lewis, Edwin Moses, Florence Griffith-Joyner and Jackie Joyner-Kersee won numerous medals.

In 1995 the brand underwent a relaunch, whereby the authentic sports orientation remained - so the national teams from Jamaica and South Africa as well as other top European teams such as AS Monaco joined the Kappa family. Fashion trends from the homeland of Italy also flowed into the sports collections. In 2000, Kappa was the first sports fashion brand to develop a body-hugging soccer jersey that caused a sensation for the first time at the 2000 European Championships when it was used by the Italian national team with the slogan “Stop Stopping”. The idea behind this was that the players can no longer be held so easily by the opponent on the jersey, or that holding on to the jersey is easier for the referee to recognize. Secondly, of course, the special functional and design-related aspects of the body-hugging cut played a major role, which were continuously developed in the course of the partnership with the various national and club teams. After the various stages of evolution of the jersey with the descriptive name ""Kool Kombat"", this item is one of the most sought-after collector's items among fans today.

Since 2000, Kappa has been the official supplier of well-known Bundesliga clubs such as FC St. Pauli, 1. FC Kaiserslautern, 1860 Munich, Werder Bremen, Borussia Dortmund, VfL Wolfsburg and Borussia Mönchengladbach. Together with BVB and Werder Bremen, the win of the double (cup win and championship) could be celebrated. In the brand new outfit from Kappa, VfL Wolfsburg was also able to celebrate the first DFB Cup victory in the club's history.

Kappa Germany is part of the  Schmidt Group . The Schmidt Group is a traditional family company based in Norderstedt near Hamburg. The company was founded in 1906. When the company was founded, the import of cotton from India and Pakistan was the company's core business. This many years of experience in the textile sector was paired with innovative product development, efficient logistics and state-of-the-art information technology. Today the Schmidt Group is a modern textile service provider with a Hanseatic tradition.

Karl Kani,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Karl Kani DESCRIPTION: Karl Kani has truly gone from rags to riches. Known as the God Father of Urban Wear, he now finds himself looking over the billion dollar industry that he inspired. He is a visionary of many first…the first to develop the baggy jean concept, the first urban fashion company to employ an all-black sales force, and the first designer to host a fashion show at the White House during President Bill Clinton's term. Growing up in Brooklyn Kani's style was inspired by Hip-Hop and street culture; apparel in this aesthetic was nowhere to be found. Without adequate clothing options, 16-year old Williams decided to make his own clothes. Friends and strangers took notice of his unique threads, and Williams soon began taking orders. He yearned to take this hobby to the next level and would ask himself the question, “Can I do it?” With more and more demand from the public for his wares, he gained the confidence to move forward. He eventually answered that incessant question, “Yes I can,” and committed himself to the challenge by legally changing his name to Karl Kani. In 1989, under his new moniker, he moved to Los Angeles to pursue this passion more seriously. 

Today the Karl Kani brand has spread internationally throughout 25 countries in Europe and 13 flagship stores in Japan, including one in Harajuku, and unlike many other high-end brands Karl Kani has stayed true to his label. His passion for quality, design and craftsmanship has meant that, Kani continues to produce all his garments in the US.

Karmyliege,"['Jewelry', 'Accessories', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: Karmyliege DESCRIPTION: Karmyliege was born from the desire to make you discover all the richness and history of cork, through collections inspired by you and for you!

It was during a trip to Portugal that I discovered the history of a material that is both aesthetic and ecological: cork.
In addition to this, you need to know more about it. The beauty of this material, discovered in a completely different form, really seduced me. Beyond its many qualities, cork tells a story, that of a country, Portugal. In addition to this, you need to know more about it. The work of cork represents in itself the main source of employment in this country , but it is also an ecological treasure that the Portuguese know better than anyone to preserve. So I started by drawing some models. However, my sketches could not have seen the light of day, without the chance meeting of a wonderful Portuguese craftsman, specialist in this very particular material. In 2014, we therefore joined forces to create the first collection of Karmyliege bags. My wish is to offer you through this collaboration the best of cork leather goods.
I spend a lot of time on site with him to develop the collections. This is a 4-handed job, combining the know-how of a small Portuguese family workshop and French elegance. 

Always with the objective of offering the best in cork leather goods, we use high-end cork with vegan  and Portuguese dyes of course. Absolutely all the accessories making up the collections come from Portugal; a guarantee of quality at the time of made in China! As for jewelry, I continue to design and manufacture them myself in my workshop located in Saintes in Charente-Maritime.  I want to highlight the material by making costume jewelry that is both simple and elegant, allowing each and every one of you to assert your style.

Lightweight, waterproof, soft, refined and supple: cork is the leather of tomorrow.

Karmyliege is also an ethical and family brand , which has received Vegan approval from PETA , the world's largest animal rights organization, as well as from ONE VOICE . This assures you of products without animal leather and colorations not tested on animals.
So, whether you are looking for crafts, French creations, alternatives to leather , bags or natural jewelry, Karmyliege is at your disposal and puts all its heart into this adventure!

The beautiful embroidery and the amazing quality are common themes within the collection. Thanks to small, colourful details such as ribbons, bows, labels and buttons, the various items in the collection are easy to combine. This results in a commercial yet unique collection.

Kind Bag,"['Bags', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Kind Bag DESCRIPTION: Kind Bag is a young and passionate company based in Hackney, London, established in 2019.

We're currently a small team working together towards our big mission. Every accessory we design has sustainability, functionality and beauty at the forefront. We put thought and care into everything we do, ensuring every last detail and its impact is considered. When there is an ever growing mountain of plastic waste, why make more when you can help reduce it?

Back in 2019, our founder Maria started Kind Bag with a mission to combat plastic pollution. Maria grew up in Tenerife, the Canary Islands surrounded by the beautiful ocean and developed an early appreciation of the natural world. Initially, a career in law beckoned, but Maria began to feel her calling lay elsewhere. It was following a stint of travelling around Asia, where her eyes were opened to the effects of plastic pollution. Although she had always been aware of environmental issues, this was her wake-up call. Maria focused all her efforts on designing a product that would help reduce the plastic mountain. Struggling to find a bag that was strong enough to fit her grocery shopping and belongings, as well as one that looked good, the idea for Kind Bag was born!

Since then, so many of you have joined our mission and Kind Bag has now rescued over 4.5 million plastic bottles from going to landfill and the ocean.

Here at Kind Bag we work hard to empower people to live a more sustainable life and make kind choices. Day by day, we are becoming a stronger force for good against plastic pollution and we are so grateful for everyone that joins us on our mission!

We knew each other from high school. Vintage clothing was our common interest and we soon had various addresses to buy beautiful vintage clothing. We sold these finds on the Amsterdam Noordermarkt and from 1983 also in our first Exota store in the Jordaan. In the 1980s, we introduced our first, own product: a black turtleneck sweater that was worn at the time with Levis 501 jeans. There was so much demand for black turtlenecks, we couldn't find enough vintage ones. We have always found it important to develop clothing that makes people happy. Vintage inspired clothing with self-designed prints, very colorful and a good fit. In the 1990s, we moved with the Exota store to Hartenstraat in Amsterdam's Nine Streets, where we are still located today. For years we have been working with many retailers and our products are available in beautiful stores throughout Europe. 

We are happy with all our partners, including the various manufacturers who make the products. We think it is very important to serve the customer as well as possible and we are still working hard every day, together with our team, for this.

We design for people who are attracted to the raw Nordic nature. Our goal is to design and produce clothes that last, in quality materials with a sustainable approach to production, colors, materials and appearance. We design everything in Denmark and produce in Portugal near Porto in smaller factories that are often run by families. We always choose sustainable materials whenever possible - our preferred materials are mulesing free merino wool and lambswool, organic cotton, linen and lyocelll. Being a sustainable brand is not a destination, but a journey that we constantly aim to improve along the way. We feel we are on the right track, but are aware that any production affects the environment. Therefore, we strive to choose materials, production sites and packaging that have as little impact on the environment as possible. By doing so - and by doing well - we hope to inspire other brands to choose a greener path with less footprint from production.

Our start came in 2012 at the heels of what was left of a 60 year old manufacturing company by the name of Watman Headwear Corp.. With the acquisition of their factory we picked up where they left off and journeyed down a new path. First established as a private label manufacturer we later introduced a label of our own. Our goal was simple then and remains so today. We believe in transparency and sustainability. It is our responsibility to the consumer, to the environment and to the industry to operate in such manner. Often times we felt guilt ridden for bringing more clothes to the marketplace. We decided in the beginning that if we are going to have a go at this we need to do it in a way that we can be proud of and to ultimately inspire others to do the same. We set out to build a community. We needed to be part of bringing together like-minded individuals who would challenge the industry’s status quo and support a movement towards responsible supply chain solutions around the world.

Kujten,"['Womenswear', 'Bodywear', 'Menswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Kujten DESCRIPTION: Kujten is the expression of Carole Benaroya and Stéphanie Eriksson’s long-standing friendship, one that started when they were teens. Throughout their years in middle and secondary school, Carole and Stéphanie discovered they were both passionate about fashion. 

From her financial background, Carole felt the urge to add some passion to her professional life in 2012, and immediately turned to her friend Stéphanie. Attentive to details and to the world’s beauty, Stéphanie is steeped in the fashion industry. She draws her expertise in knitwear and cashmere from working in Joseph’s Parisian styling department, an English fashion house that is renowned for its knitwear. Kujten arose from their love for an exceptional material: cashmere. Their ambition to start their own cashmere brand was confirmed following a first trip to Mongolia, where they fell in love with the blue-sky country.

Kūlson,['Footwear'],"BRAND: Kūlson DESCRIPTION: For every pair of sneakers we sell, we donate 4% of the proceeds to organizations dedicated to removing plastic and lost fishing nets from oceans.

Since our founding in 2017, we have thus been able to effectively and continuously support the following institutions:

Sea Shepherd, The Great Bubble Barrier, Healthy Seas, The Ocean Cleanup, 1% for the Planet, and Waste Free Oceans. If nothing is done to stop littering in the oceans, there could be more plastic swimming in this majestic yet fragile ecosystem than fish before 2050.

So the next time you see a bottle, plastic lid or straw lying on the beach, please pick it up and throw it in a trash can.

Wait and see how good it feels.

A personality of electrifying contrasts. She was in shoe business for many years and she entered the project following her unsatisfied quest for shoes that were well made, flattering but different by colour and structure at the same time. She calls her creations an artistic encounter between considerate craftsmanship and outward creativity resulting in a casual chic style with a twist. When designing, Evelyne envisages the KUNOKA women, whose style is the expression of her personality. She is not afraid to be different, but in a distinguished way, she does not fear to embrace colour as a surprising element in a classy outfit, and she is intrigued by unexpected textures as an extra dimension to what she wears. The KUNOKA woman is sophisticated yet a little different, we call it wayward.

K-WAY,"['Accessories', 'Kidswear', 'Menswear', 'Womenswear']","BRAND: K-WAY DESCRIPTION: Its small English-sounding name has often made people forget its ch'ti origins. The nylon banana pouch that turns into a brightly colored windbreaker was in fact designed by Léon-Claude Duhamel, son of a textile industrialist from Nord-Pas-de-Calais. Red, yellow, blue, green are thus interfering in the dull wardrobe of the French who had not yet opted for the boldness and freedom of the sixties. A revolution of codes and mentalities was underway, and K-Way, without knowing it, contributed to it. Iconic and modern clothing, it was adored as much as hated in the schoolyards of the 1970s and 1980s. Having become a collector with its tricolor closure, the K-Way ended up disappearing from France when the word entered the world. the dictionary alongside Bic or Scotch.

Twenty years later, at the dawn of the 2000s, Italian elegance took a liking to Claude or Le Léon, original models whose cuts have been revisited. Slipped under a jacket, it becomes THE fashion touch, light, comfortable, technical and ultra trendy.

Marc Jacobs, Maje, Petit Bateau, Colette and l'Eclaireur are launching their capsule collection with the brand which is rediscovering its French roots by opening its first boutiques. The range is expanding (reversible down jacket, parka, luggage, bag, polo shirts ...) and the quality goes upmarket. The K-Way 3.0 is tear-proof, 100% waterproof but breathable, and keeps its DNA: protect against rain, wind and cold while being resolutely pop, whether oversized or curved. And that's how the K-Way makes the umbrella out of date! Who can resist K-style?

A womenswear collection for confident women with a recognizable feminine signature. We know our customer and we love to be part of her world. We do recognize trends, but we decide not to follow all of them. Since Kyra & Ko started in 2003 we set our own course. Thanks to this approach we have developed an authentic identity that has become increasingly clear in our feminine signature and matches with the wishes of our customers.

The Kyra look is distinctive and at the same time functional. The feminine, wide-ranging collection offers many possibilities and can be worn both easy-going and more formal.

At Kyra we believe in the power of doing it together. We design and develop the collection with a small, dedicated team based in the Netherlands. We produce the collection mainly in Europe with a small group of loyal manufacturers. We believe that doing it together creates the best product.

By inventing the metal frame, they revolutionised the backpack. This model, used by France’s first recipients of paid leave, became the icon of a new carefree spirit and was a feature of early leisure activities. This background has earned it a special place in the hearts of French people and of adventurers the world over. Since 1930, we have revisited our collection and updated our products. Our values, however, have stayed the same: authenticity, sharing and accessibility are at the heart of our daily work. In the 1990s, we embraced two further values: protecting our playgrounds, and raising awareness of the need to enjoy leisure responsibly. We share this vision with each member of our community, mindful of offering future generations the inspirational feeling of the great outdoors.
This background has fostered our taste for adventures – and whether they are ordinary or extraordinary, in the mountains or the city, and in daily life or on your travels, Lafuma is your loyal companion, inviting you to take off: “Away has never been so close”.

LAMARQUE,"['Womenswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: LAMARQUE DESCRIPTION: LAMARQUE was founded in 2012 in Montreal’s garment district by third-generation leather tanners, who were one of North America’s largest leather suppliers and pioneers of the Canadian leather industry of the time. LAMARQUE specializes in luxurious leather garments contemporary apparel, and elevated outerwear. LAMARQUE is committed to achieving the essence of urban elegance with each design. Its trademark “effortlessly chic” look and its foundation stem from the iconic perfecto. However, LAMARQUE’s vision and design reach is much more than a leather jacket — it transposes the signature luxury of the brand throughout the entire collection, from polished silk blouses, to classically chic wool coats, refined puffer coats, and everything in between. Each collection stems from a unique creative vision, mixing timeless designs with contemporary trends, colours, and cuts. Each piece is carefully constructed with the final fit and style in mind. LAMARQUE continuously strives to offer modern design edge with every collection, while maintaining an unwavering commitment to outstanding quality. LAMARQUE truly values social responsibility and sustainability. Not only do they have a no-fur policy that they firmly stand behind, but they also use alternative chrome-free tanning methods on most of their leather pieces, considerably reducing the negative environmental impacts of the traditional process. LAMARQUE believes that apparel, particularly leather garments, should not be disposable, but rather treasured, respected, and worn with the utmost pride and appreciation, from now until forever.

Since my new brand’s first steps, it was natural for me to create a watch line.

Tonino Lamborghini ideates its products through a perfect synergy between the family’s passion for mechanics and art from which the brand inherits its unmistakable Italian design deeply inspired by Lamborghini’s DNA.

There is ONE volume for every year of existance of La Petite Mort. Every new volume adds-up to our permanent collection of urban-wear pieces, it does not replace it.
All work is manual, from patterns to cutting, from assembling to embroidery. The imperfection of manual work is a constant reminder of the humanity behind each piece and (I personally believe) it adds character to the most simple item.
Due to our handmade-only process, mass-production is not possible. CLEAN
As long as we’re alive footprint is impossible to avoid, but it can be minimized.

Further than organic labelling (GOTS for cotton & Oeko-tex for wool), inspired by the cradle to cradle principle, all pieces are conceived so they are suitable for recycling and even composting! -> less clothing waste on landfills. In order to do so, they remain 100% natural, there is NO FIBER BLEND. Furthermore, all sewing threads and even the inner tags are made in natural materials.

FAIR
All production is made in collaboration with local entrepreneurs and women cooperatives (currently where all fibers are sourced, Peru).
Prices and timings are fixed by them, according to their capacity, availability and characteristics of each piece.

With a personal meeting once a year, the rest of the time contact remains frequent and direct thanks to technologie (whatsapp!).

The ethical treatment of our employees is our top priority and the foundation we are built upon. The concept of being relaxed is a personal ethos. It’s about knowing and accepting who you are and where your place is in your world. Being comfortable with yourself, body and mind and soul.
It’s about making choices that can take slightly less away from our planet. It’s feeling that you got the most out of your day in a meaningful way, not by anyone else’s measure of productivity. Feeling relaxed is feeling at peace with yourself, despite the often-chaotic world we all inhabit.

The clothing we produce is a reflection of that ethos. We want it to be a given; that the clothes you put on your body won’t harm it, won’t cause unnecessary damage to the Earth or pain to the human being who made the clothes, that it will fit and flatter, that it will feel great and inspire you to make authentic choices. Being “relaxed” is a lifestyle and an intentional choice we can all make.

Larsson & Jennings,"['Accessories', 'Eyewear', 'Jewelry']","BRAND: Larsson & Jennings DESCRIPTION: When Larsson & Jennings launched in 2012, we set out to disrupt the industry, paving a path away from the mass market and unsustainable production with watches that are manufactured responsibly and efficiently. The fashion watch market is monopolised by licence agreements between huge companies and large-scale brands that use watches as a revenue stream and marketing tool. It’s a volume play, and for the most part there isn’t much thought or care put into the design process or the way these products are made.
So we set out to do things differently and we brought out a range of watches that combined integrity of design, quality and value for money. 
Andrew Jennings had always loved watches, having inherited a vintage Rolex at the age of 10 from his uncle. It sounds obvious – start a business based around something you love – but it took Andrew a few years of sitting behind a desk in London’s financial district feeling unfulfilled before he realised he could turn his dream into a reality. 
After a trip to Stockholm in 2010 to see his friend, Joakim Larsson, Andrew was inspired by the city’s minimal Scandinavian style to create a watch that would strike the perfect balance between modern and classic. So he came back to London, quit his job in the city and took a risk.
It was a good idea, and good ideas get copied. But we remain true to our values - innovating, creating classic timeless products in a sustainable way and always striving to be better. 
Today Larsson & Jennings continues to draw design elements from Stockholm & London with a key focus on sustainability and longevity.

We also believe that what we do should be gentle to our environment. We are increasingly choosing natural fabrics and yarns that are produced in environmentally friendly ways, e.g. by committing to using Lyocell® we support clean air, clean water and a healthy environment. We also support green cleaning by working to eliminate conventional dry cleaning for our clothing in favor of hand and machine washing in cold water. Our mission is by 2025 to have 70% of our clothing made from fabrics and yarns that are friendly to the environment.

LDNR,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Bodywear', 'Sportswear']","BRAND: LDNR DESCRIPTION: LNDR was founded by three active, international women, based in London, who wanted to create a brand around ""the lifestyle we want to live, the products we want to wear, and the people we wanted to hang out with."" We genuinely believe in better quality products and less of them. We believe the day of fast fashion is over - for state of mind and the planet. We don’t want a new outfit every month. We want hands down great products that we don’t have to think about.

LNDR products are made with cutting-edge technology and a fanatical attitude towards quality and fit. It can take factories up to 20 times longer to knit LNDR seamless leggings, for instance, compared to other brands. Each and every LNDR product is precision engineered to perform, whether you’re sweating through a METCON, pounding the city streets, or meeting up with mates at the pub for a few well-earned negroni's. 

Clean, fresh styling and tonal colour-ways make for easy-to-wear, put-together looks that you can just throw on and go. We don’t do trends, gimmicks, influencers or compromise. We just do killer kit that feels as great as it looks.

LEKI's unique development started as a result of the founders' personal dissatisfaction: Karl Lenhart, an avid skier himself, was less than impressed by the quality and functionality of the ski poles of the time. Therefore, he used his own machine park to manufacture grips and baskets for skiing poles. These went into mass production in the 60s. On the other hand, Lenhart was familiar with aluminium and composite processing on account of his aircraft manufacturing experience. In 1970, he used these raw materials to produce his first ski poles to be sold under the LEKI brand, which stands for the owners and the company headquarters, i.e. Lenhart in Kirchheim.

What are they made of? Where do the fibers of this material come from?
If you don't know how to answer this question, it's because fast fashion has taken away its meaning from clothing.
I am convinced that wearing a garment tells something about us. Knowing where a jacket has been designed, and by whom, is not trivial. To wear ""Le Modeste"" is to assert an ethic with elegance.

Why ""Le Modeste""?

We failed, we faced challenges, we competed, we won and we celebrated.  I look back and see moments of doubt. I see joys hard to explain to those who didn’t live them. By my side those who’ve been with me through all these years, I see them younger, fighting against everything that has arisen. I see intensity and also moments of pure happiness. All this stays forever! I also feel that it was when we broke away with preconceptions and rules, when we were bold in the search of new ideas that we felt that the whole process made more sense. The result is a product of our imagination that feeds this passion to be where we like the most.  In each Lemon Jelly there’s a reflection of all these experiences, which transformed us and were preparing us so that today we can claim that we have products of excellence. We keep going ahead with gathered wisdom but the same eagerness and desire to improve your day.

On all the trousers there are even two popper positions: one for before dinner and one for after, genius. Linen is a woefully underestimated fabric that Lemuel MC exclusively shines the spotlight on…Flax from which linen is made is a brilliant crop, incredibly resilient meaning minimal pesticide intervention, and able to grow using far less water than cotton (6.4 litres vs 2,700 litres for cotton). The entire plant can be woven into fibre or used meaning minimal waste whilst also being biodegradable and recyclable, incredibly strong and breathable with natural thermal properties, the fibre is biodegradable and recyclable. It is a chameleon of a fabric which can compete with wool, denim, cotton and silks without the associated environmental impacts and humanitarian impacts.

All \Lemuel MC patterns are original, created through organic development and finalised using what already exists; charity shop wallpaper finds that provide the required materials structure but remove the use of new materials, treading lightly on the planet. Hand drawn, hand stamped labels created from offcuts, telling the story and love of linen sit alongside care labels that really ca\re and remind you to care too…

Seasonless style for maximum wear & longevity. Made To Order production process eliminating overproduction and the waste of finite resources. Bespoke alterations available to get the perfect fit so each piece stays in your wardrobe for the longest time possible. Free repairs for life- because Lemuel MC love what they create for life.

Because an enterprising and artistic spirit is the driving force behind the young women of today.

Les Deux,['Menswear'],"BRAND: Les Deux DESCRIPTION: Les Deux was born from a chance meeting between two very different people, with contrasting personalities, who found themselves united in recognising opportunities. Two distinct souls on divergent paths with shared ambitions.

Often, in the meeting of opposites, something profound happens. A spark ignites. It is then you can excel and stand out from the crowd – you can dare to carve your own path. This is the raison d’ëtre of Les Deux. Les Deux designs clothes that make people challenge their habits, confront the status quo. Les Deux does what it takes - and do it with a shared sense of purpose.

Some might say that you are as classy as the clothes you wear. Les Deux believes true class is shown by your actions. Class is consideration, compassion, and the willingness to give your all. Les Deux never gives up. They give back. Shares the success and perseveres. Les Deux works as one but let each individual pursue their own dream. Les Deux is about leaving a mark – a legacy that has lasting meaning. Ensuring sustainability and compassion are at the heart of what is created, the designs and communication.

Les Deux works from the statement: believe in what you do and get the job done. Life has its own driving forces and so does Les Deux. Opposites spark opportunites. Embrace difference. Wholesale

Drawing their inspiration from nature and the animals, they garnish their sketchbooks with enchanting and fantasy bestiaries, cosmopolitan landscapes and luxuriant vegetation. With Les Néréides, they develop a brand of jewellery boldly bucolic where flowers and animals are the heroes of refined designs.

The history of the brand could not be written without including their four children, who are now all part of the life of the company.

During an illness, she started knitting to add colour to difficult days. Today she has still not recovered physically, but mentally she is stronger than ever before. She's alive and buzzing with ideas, enjoying every little victory over her destiny. O, as in empOwerment, transcends individual history. Because Les Tricots d'O is the work of many hands. All these knitters enrich Odette's eclectic personality and aim for a common goal, because they are united by the love of this ancient craft. As they knit, they tell the same story and yet each creation is unique.

LEWIS & MELLY,['Womenswear'],"BRAND: LEWIS & MELLY DESCRIPTION: Lewis & Melly is the hip, young fashion label of brother and sister Louis and Melanie Lemmens. Born in a family where fashion was used creatively, they struggled to find affordable and yet unique garments. Trying to escape soulless commercialism and underpaid holiday jobs, they emptied their bank accounts and started a fashion experiment. Their playful and striking glitter creations became an instant internet hit. This living room project grew thanks to the increasing attention of influencers and the launch of our webshop, into an established value with its own production studio and three Belgian flagship stores. Living room appointments led to shopping events, until the city garden became too small for the enthusiastic buyers. When the pop-up shop in Wijnegem had a 100 meter long queue at the opening and was completely sold out in 90 minutes, the designer duo began to get to grips with the idea of an initial success story.

By focusing on exclusive sales and smart use of social media, the youngsters succeeded in setting up a well-functioning production studio, launching an online webshop and opening flagship stores in Wijnegem, Knokke and Ghent. The webshop not only opens the way to the international market, but also provides a growing attention for influencers.

Our best assets? A sharp eye for trends, the ideal combination of glamour and affordability and a strong connection to the fan base. With their designs, Louis and Melanie perfectly respond to the duality that is embedded in their young target group: the pieces are both exclusive and affordable, glamorous and comfortable, tough and romantic, dressed and playful, special and simple.

Melanie (designer & art director) is the graphic and artistic brain within Lewis & Melly. She designs collection pieces based on the common vision, leads the sewing workshop and webshop, and manages the social media accounts.

Louis (designer & creative director) has a keen eye for trends, media and bizniz. He keeps the overview and directs the production, sets out lines together with Melanie and also designs collection pieces.Together with Melanie he creates images and looks to share on social media.

LIDEA,"['Womenswear', 'Swimwear']","BRAND: LIDEA DESCRIPTION: It's like experiencing the last beautiful weekend of an otherwise rainy summer. Right now you should rush outside, go to the swimming pool, eat ice cream, jump into the lake and have a barbecue. Soon it will rain, then the chance is missed! But a summer weekend is no fun if you are constantly reminded that your bikini body is still not ""top"" and the summer will soon be over. Many people are no longer very interested in spending a lot of time with their dress size. This is also reflected in swimwear. It's all about serenity, a casual attitude, in other words bikini and swimsuits that are ageless. You can wear them at 20 or 50, you can wear them at 36 or 52.

Small sizes are just smarter? Definitely not. LIDEA develops swimwear for women who find themselves beautiful as they are and know how fashion underlines this attitude. Maturity in dealing with one's own body, for us this means Body Positivity.

In 2010, we founded the LIEBLINGSSTÜCK label and have stood for emotional fashion with a love of detail ever since. In recent years, LIEBLINGSSTÜCK has developed into an honest partner for upmarket specialist and chain store retailers in the ""Modern Premium Woman"" segment.

Our daily endeavor is to pay the greatest possible attention to every single activity in our value chain in order to get a little closer to our goals and dreams, step by step. The challenge, however, is to develop high-quality products that always bear our unmistakable signature and convey the LIEBLINGSSTÜCK message to the outside world. People are always at the center of everything we do. LIEBLINGSSTÜCK stands for feminine, casual fashion with a feel-good character. Nothing makes a woman more beautiful than her own belief in it - that's what we want to achieve with our collections!

We don't see clothing as lifeless material, but as something emotional; something that awakens associations in us and accompanies us throughout our lives. It is the attention to detail that makes every single LIEBLINGSSTÜCK something very special and gives our customers an equally special charisma. LIEBLINGSSTÜCK wearers are self-confident, have both feet firmly on the ground and emphasize their individuality with ease. Our fashion conveys a feeling of freedom and informality, allowing us to literally breathe a sigh of relief and forget the stress of everyday life for a moment. It is fashion that does not restrict us. Soft, cuddly fabrics in flattering colors and loose cuts envelop us like a feel-good cocoon in which we can relax and be ourselves.

Our conviction: A smile is the most beautiful accessory a woman can wear!

LILIMILL,['Footwear'],"BRAND: LILIMILL DESCRIPTION: LILIMILL is a single word made up of two parts. LILI is the diminutive of Liliana, the founder of the company while MILL has the meaning of a small workshop. The image that is evoked by the word LILIMILL is thus precisely that of a small atelier where the shoes are handcrafted, combining the excellence of the local tradition and the passion of the founder who, in 1974 together with her husband Alfredo Vespasiani, began to create women shoes in the Marche region, one of the most important shoe districts in Italy.

LILIMILL shoes can actually tell a story.

A story made of dreams, research, creativity, work, taste, beauty, elegance. LILIMILL is therefore not only the name of a brand but becomes synonymous of a very specific style: romantic and glamorous, trendy without excess, sophisticated and jaunty.

LILIMILL is the softness of the leathers, the elegance that does not give up comfort, the details that make the difference, the quality and uniqueness of the ""made in Italy"", the romantic but still gritty essence of his creations and the beauty of things done with the heart.

Lisette L Montreal,['Womenswear'],"BRAND: Lisette L Montreal DESCRIPTION: We believe that women of all shapes and sizes deserve to look great but also feel their best in the pants they wear — point finale. After all, pants can be likened to a second skin, meant to move with you as you navigate your day, no matter what you have planned. In 30 years of working in fashion sales, Lisette L founder and creative designer, Lisette Limoges, and her husband Neil had yet to come across a pair of pants that fit the bill when it came to both comfort and style.

So, in 2001, they set out to design something that would fuse fashion with both fit and function; a piece that could empower any woman to feel amazing while tackling whatever comes her way. 

What they created was a pair of perfectly fitting pants.

Here we can show and tell you what our DNA is, what we stand for and what message we want to bring to the world. A message we feel is important, cause our children are the future.

Little Hedonist is a 100% dutch label and our products are based on the thought that baby- and toddlerstuff can be of great comfort and be fashionable at the same time. With our minimalistic design, fantastic fit and the best quality in fabric we create a collection that is not just a basic collection, but a Basic Couture Collection. Essentials that are a must-have in all children’s closets, items that upgrade the wardrobe even if they are basics. Cause there are so many things we want, yet little we actually need in life. Especially in clothing. With this in mind, we created a nononsense, high quality, durable, incredibly comfy and fashionable collection for your child to wear all year round. Clothes that last so the environment will last as well. We use organic materials, of course. But also recycled material, we don’t just consume, use and throw away. Since we all have children that we buy clothes for, we need to keep in mind that the world is changing and needs awareness to not destroy it. Think of the climate changes for instance. We love our children so we should also love the world they live in. So they also have a great world to live in when they grow older, and have children of their own.

We encourage buyers, stores, consumers to buy sustainable like we are. To pay maybe a bit more for something that lasts longer. To be aware of the future. Cause our children are the future! Let’s contribute to keep the world a good place.

Established in Spain, Lois was the first European fashion jeans brand to conquer the world. We flourished in the 70’s and 80’s when our iconic fits and flares were worn by influential fashion icons and musicians. Before we knew it, our jeans were all over the dance floor. Between other great jeans brands of that time Lois brought something new; a sexy and fashionable pair of jeans. Finding the perfect balance between comfort and style revolutionised the jeans forever. Lois was colourful, corduroy and full of ‘flare’. Soon young people all over the world recognised Lois as their perfect fit. Lois was a first and a favourite of the movers and shakers of the 70’s and onwards.
 
Apart from the poetry of the past, we also look forward because finding and improving the sexiest, most effortless fits will never tire us. Lois is designed in Amsterdam, the denim capital of the world but just like the beginning, it’s made by the oldest tailor family in Spain. There is love in these jeans, share the love with Lois.

Lola Ramona,"['Footwear', 'Bags', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Lola Ramona DESCRIPTION: Lola Ramona began in 2006 in Copenhagen with an idea that stemmed from a question; in a market consumed with shoes created for the masses, where were the shoes for the few? Lola Ramona was created to bring shoes that were packed with attitude and life, shoes that said something about you as a person so if you wore them you were making an expression about your personality. Not only this, they were created with women’s feet as the central focus. What good are beautiful shoes that destroy your feet? Your shoes should be there to help protect and pamper your feet. So, Lola Ramona sought to create beautifully designed shoes that could be worn from dawn until dusk and back again. This was the vision in 2006 and it has endured the test of time as the company still creates beautiful shoes that provide supreme quality and comfort. However, we are now so much more. We are the brand that brings you everything. Our collections include Sneakers, kids shoes, vegan showstoppers all standing tall alongside our classic Angie’s and Ava's. Dots, bows and stripes created the central theme of Lola Ramona back in 2006 a classic look that was distinguishable from afar as being a Lola design. Still today that classic look is clear to see in our designs none more so than in our new Spring summer collection. 

Our new collections in 2021 will see us continue to diversify and create shoes for larger feet designed to be inclusive to as many people as we can. We will continue our support for the LGBTQAI+ community with two new collections for WorldPride and FSTB. Our Spring Summer collection includes designs that are the most true to the Lola Ramona brand that we have ever created. Exciting patterns and styles are aplenty, each one individually handmade ensuring the highest possible quality and comfort across all of our shoes. From leather styles to vegan you can be sure when wearing a Lola Ramona you are wearing a quality piece of footwear. 

Welcome to Lola Ramona, welcome to the family, we can’t wait to get to know you.

Love
Lola X

LO NEEL,"['Womenswear', 'Accessories', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: LO NEEL DESCRIPTION: Lo Neel is a vegan and sustainable designer brand as chic as ethical.
Launched last year, the young LO NEEL brand bets on reconciling style, ethics and sustainability through poetic-rock collections with an assertive look. The LO NEEL adventure 

The story of LO NEEL is the story of a mother-daughter duo determined to shake up the codes. Faced with the many controversies shaking up the fashion industry, Frédérique, stylist and collection director, and Loane, a business school student, decide to launch together a brand that corresponds to their values in terms of ethics and eco-responsibility. Thus, in June 2019, LO NEEL was born. Named in tribute to the explorer Alexandra David-Neel, the brand offers a complete wardrobe of affordable, high-quality pieces. Finely hand-embroidered blouses, dresses with flounces in a bohemian spirit, or the emblematic pineapple fiber perfecto with its spectacular handmade embroidery claim the mix of genres for a refined, poetic look, twisted with a hint of rock. 
A fashion respecting people, the planet and animals.

Resolutely turned towards the future, LO NEEL is at the forefront of the slow-fashion trend in France thanks to its DNA entirely articulated around ethical and committed values. Thus, all pieces are vegan and certified cruelty-free by PETA. Made from natural, organic or recycled materials, far from large production lines, the collections are designed in small workshops based in India. Skilled craftsmen benefit from working conditions well above the national average. Finally, in an approach that favors quality over quantity, the LO NEEL collections are offered in limited editions, and enriched with capsules over the seasons. 

The challenge of innovation

In addition to the style and the virtuous dimension of its collections, the young brand is also a success thanks to its innovative spirit. A process that translates into real research work in order to use surprising new organic and vegan materials, such as pineapple leather, soya fiber, and Forest certified viscose from sustainable forests. Available on the Internet, in the brand's showroom or in ephemeral boutiques, the LO NEEL collections prove that another way of consuming fashion is possible, by privileging ethics without ever giving up style!
New pieces made in France and Italy are available.

Loreak Mendian,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear']","BRAND: Loreak Mendian DESCRIPTION: Loreak Mendian is a textile brand founded in 1995 in San Sebastián. Over the years the creative team has grown and matured to design more careful and contemporary pieces, inspired by the environment but with a global vision.

With a vocation to dress the world with functional and timeless garments. We believe in a transparent and honest design, in the face of artifice and the ephemerality of trends. The proposal is based on an unprejudiced look at fashion, from a need for fun and enjoyment, but emphasizing the usefulness and quality of the pieces, bringing the masculine and feminine worlds closer together, and revisiting the classics to reinterpret them in a sporting way, from a very current and contemporary perspective.

Loreak Mendian rests on three pillars: landscape, know-how and art.

The landscape represents the starting point from which the world is contemplated. Surrounded by mountains, stone and the Atlantic Sea, far from the big city and the tumult. This allows the freedom to experiment from a distance, to enjoy different rhythms and a spontaneity that is applied directly to the collections.

When it comes to know-how, it talks about the way in which the processes of making and making the pieces are understood. We want to make use of the best materials worked carefully and paying special attention to the construction details of the garments. Quality raw materials and transparency are also a fundamental part of what Loreak Mendian is, an expression of its creativity.

The brand is steeped in the culture that surrounds it, the spirit of the moment. They like to be exposed to new experiences and never stop being amazed by new music, cinema, graphic design or any type of artistic expression. This inspires and motivates his designs, always in a just balance between aesthetics and functionality, his contemporary character and his timeless spirit.

Being a luxury lingerie brand with the characteristic of making all its models in all sizes is not something you can improvise! Since 1938, Louisa Bracq has been making elegant, sophisticated, feminine and even resolutely unclassifiable creations.
We have been designers and manufacturers of embroidery for the Haute Couture industry since 1938. In the 90’s we started offering our services to the High-End Lingerie segment. After having trained the best corsetiers to the requirements of the house, Louisa Bracq changed status from embroidery supplier to lingerie designer by launching her own lines in 2007. Since 2014 Matthieu Bracq, great-grandson of the founder becomes the artistic director of the brand. But the creed does not change: Louisa Bracq remains faithful to the know-how, the harmony and the sophisticated colors of the style of her founder.

Who does like to wait? This was the question when Wendy was thinking 7 years ago to start a new label for modern pregnant. With 15 years of experience they had gained in another brand she went to work on it! It turned in particular to the statement that there is no ""trendy clothes"" existed for pregnant woman. And that's why she actually as soon as possible turned back to her 'normal' clothes to wear. And so they turned it around: why should they not be able to design maternity wear to make it worth waiting for the baby! And so it happened. Thus arose the name LOVE2WAIT and hence the incentive to design new trendy maternity clothes!

Soon came the modern pregnant woman Romy in their path. She told of ""The Story of Romy"" exactly what the story about Wendy want to bring to all pregnant women; ""During your pregnancy there is no need to change your own identity! Our clothing is fashionable and indistinguishable from the latest fashion. ""

Meanwhile LOVE2WAIT, a young company, you can’t go over it in fashionable life. Not in the least because of the trendy jeans that fits naturally. Jeans that more and more also by non-pregnant women be worn. The crew of LOVE2WAIT, which mainly consists of women, also wearing regular jeans from the collection. Often accompanied by a trendy top with a so characteristic L2W print!

Gazing over the racks, she realized her options were either sporty spice or tutu-romance. And so, in 2013, Love Stories founder and creative director Marloes Hoedeman took a piece of paper and sharpened her pencil to design lingerie that’s as versatile as she knew women to be. The type of lingerie that makes you feel beautiful, minus the discomfort. Sexy but not sex.

With a background in interior design, Marloes took on this adventure without traditional rules or boundaries, because she simply wasn’t aware of them. Et voilà, Love Stories was born: an innovative lingerie brand that celebrates the bralette as the sexiest, most feminine, most comfortable piece of lingerie in the world. A holiday for your boobs. Each collection is a mix & match extravaganza of prints and patterns. After all, lingerie is part of your outfit – the first layer, your mood for the day.

... in 2009, when Sabine, the founder of our brand, after spending 10 years with the family business Jacqueline Riu alongside her mother, decided to write her own story. Her meeting with Marie-noëlle Besançon and the residents of the association ""Les invités au festin"" who participate in many creative workshops is a revelation: she wants to give meaning to her profession. Driven by her insatiable curiosity and her desire to continue the life of works made in all manual art workshops, Sabine will put her experience of the market and ready-to-wear for the benefit of solidarity associations, to give birth to a collection of ""meaning"" clothing. The world of fashion and the associative environment that everything seemed to oppose now have everything to collaborate.

His meeting with committed fashion designer Marcia de Carvalho is decisive: the first collection for women was launched in 2011 under the RE(STORE)D Orphan Socks label. Made in Sens was born.

 ""Made In Sens is a touching human adventure made of encounters between artists, solidarity associations and the world of fashion""

This is how Sabine and Mary, mother and daughter, made their name a rule of conduct:

CHICHE to give meaning to fashion,

CHICHE to give meaning to our professions,

Since our beginnings in 1994, we have wanted to know who and what is behind our production. That's why we have not only begun to look at the people behind our products, but have always dealt intensively with the origins of our goods and the associated manufacturing processes since the beginning of our company. As our name addition THE NATURE TEXTILE COMPANY strongly says, we specialize in working with natural materials such as cotton, wool, linen or hemp. Natural materials are simply beautiful. In order for our products to do justice to their origin, we have always attached great importance to an ecological, careful handling of our goods. As a matter of course, we therefore reject the use of pesticides in the cultivation of the sustainable raw materials we use. Similarly, when using raw materials of animal origin, we make sure that we only use raw materials from controlled organic animal husbandry. Since the work has intensified and become more complex in the course of our existence, we decided in 2012 to have our company certified according to the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS).

I love pretty things, beautiful materials and above all, bags. This is where the problem started to arise because no longer consuming meat and continuing to buy leather was becoming inconsistent. Both come from the same circuits and come out of the same sordid places that are the slaughterhouses. So, one day, I decided to make my dream come true: to create 100% vegan bags (without animal material) and when I officially launched MAGNETHIK in April 2016, I had been working on this beautiful project for a year already . At the time, this philosophy of life was still reserved for a small community and only foreign designers offered vegan bags. It is in this context that I created MAGNETHIK, which became the first committed fashion brand Made in France.

I love this story which, out of my imagination, was written with you. Undoubtedly, veganism and ecology are the future for me. I wanted a brand for the women of today and tomorrow, modern, visionary and responsible consumers. MAGNETHIK is first and foremost a story of influence, of attraction between what is good and what is beautiful.

Even before we were born, we thought about how to create a brand that would be effective in three dimensions: environmental, economic and social. It was essential to create a company that generates sustainable wealth over time, without overlooking the impact on the environment and the people. Our purpose is to offer a product and experience that are both aesthetic and functionally aligned with our and values and  those of the MAGNO MONTERO community.

While also ensuring that we make the best decisions possible regarding the selection of sustainable fabrics, the search for responsible manufacturers, and any other factor that has a direct impact on the three dimensions.

Environmental, Economic and Social.

But not just any street, this little street emphasises everything that our label stands for; sophisticated, classic, vintage, chic and a bit naughty.

Maison Alfa,"['Womenswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Maison Alfa DESCRIPTION: Maison ALFA is love and passion for the fashion profession with a capital M. It is going back to the fundamentals, to the creation by hand, to the meticulous choice of the fabric, to the finesse of the cuts...
Originally, Maison ALFA was an idea, even a conviction! The conviction that wearing an outfit is getting to know yourself a little better. It's knowing what you want to show about yourself to others. From this idea, a reflection. First go see what the other creative workshops are doing. Then realise that the clothes are original, but that the soul, the convictions of these brands are similar: they make beauty without giving a deeper meaning to their creations.

Why ALFA? Because the ALPHA method is a method to facilitate the learning of the alphabet to children, by telling them a story.
At Maison ALFA, we have therefore chosen to tell you the story of the garment you wear to help you better understand and love it. The choice of fabric, the history of its making, the meticulousness that sewed it so that you can make it your own.
This is our fashion ALPHA method.

A feeling of comfort and simplicity, a style that is easy to wear and which offers a scope for free expression to the woman wearing it. The MRK signature: beautiful fabrics, attention to texture and detail, down to the smallest finishing touch.

A woman who is fundamentally free.

Judith Milgrom's family.
The soul of this tribe is what inspired Judith Milgrom to create a brand
that is evidently cross-generational, where women and their daughters share the pleasure of dressing. Now, she's bringing the Parisian woman
that she imagined, out into the world.
Because ultimately, isn’t the Parisian woman
the most cosmopolitan of them all?

Maje conveys a whimsical grace that transcends time.

This feat turns on round-trip tickets
between past, present and future.

Majestic Filatures,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear']","BRAND: Majestic Filatures DESCRIPTION: Majestic Filatures is a timeless brand which, since 1989, has crossed eras and styles without worrying about being fashionable, but with the concern to remain so! “ If you are going to do something, don’t do it like everyone else. ”

With this advice in mind, given from a dad, tailor by trade, that Rolland Chelly created Majestic Filatures. Through a unique and a bit crazy concept in 1989: make the t-shirt a noble and high-quality product.

The passion, the “fire”, the will to make something different and democratize the premium universe allowed Rolland Chelly to very easily cross the road with Joseph Tricot, who instantly trusted him. What followed was a collaboration of over 30 years in the production of t-shirts. A strong point to this collaboration was the production of, by the the Parisian atelier, in the beginning, pieces for other brands like Rykiel and even Dior, before addressing retailers and customers.

But in order to develop itself, stay true to the brand’s DNA and produce accessible high-quality fashion, made in Europe, and without compromising quality, Roland Chelly had the idea of producing his own threads! That’s the strength point that allowed Majestic Filatures to have a large freedom of creation and materials combinations.

Manhattan Portage,"['Accessories', 'Bags']","BRAND: Manhattan Portage DESCRIPTION: Our Story

There was a simple philosophy that Manhattan Portage set out to achieve back in 1983, ""New York Tough."" We sought to take the functionality of outdoor gear/packs and bring them to an urban audience. We took materials like CORDURA brand nylon and high quality plastic Delrin buckles and incorporated them into a new urban aesthetic that is chic, innovative, and confident. Our bags and backpacks have since earned their street creed; they are reliable and tough companions on the streets of New York City, the epicenter of culture. What was originally designed for bike messengers in NYC and DJ'S in the East Village has become mainstream. Despite our lasting success, we remain committed to the fundamental guidelines that we set years ago for great innovative designs, the use of the highest materials, and excellent craftsmanship.

We've used the experience, skills, technical innovations and the successes of the past three decades to expand and diversify your portfolio to meet the challenges and changes of the new century. Our versatility, durability, and adaptability have allowed us to survive the ebb and flow of mercurial fashion tides, that's why we own ""New York Tough."" It's become part of our history and it's in our DNA",https://www.manhattanportage.com,"{'neg': 0.02, 'neu': 0.846, 'pos': 0.135, 'compound': 0.9756}",0.9756,Positive,en
Manos del Uruguay,"['Womenswear', 'Jewelry', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Manos del Uruguay DESCRIPTION: Manos del Uruguay was born in 1968 out of a simple question: How can we improve the quality of life of Uruguay's rural women? 

The answer was in handcrafts, using skills inherited from our mothers and grandmothers and the raw material that we had at hand: wool. That's how Manos del Uruguay was founded, to give Uruguay's rural women jobs, that would mean, not just an income, but also an opportunity to personally develop and gain independence, keeping their roots and traditions, close to their community and families.

She studied Fashion Design at The Art school of Willem de Kooning academie in Rotterdam. Dutch culture is an essential part of Manou’s work.
She explores the mundane everyday life in the Netherlands with clothing and looks for undiscovered shapes and ideas within that. 
In every collection she uses vintage and dead-stock materials, this way she minimises the impact her work has on the environment. 

Despite the mundane inspirations of her collections, she looks for current and contemporary clothes that in a way will romanticise the everyday.

Marble Berriez,"['Womenswear', 'Kidswear', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: Marble Berriez DESCRIPTION: About Marble Berriez
Marble Berriez is a new Dutch sustainable clothing brand. Our clothing is produced in the Netherlands and is made from 100% environmentally friendly materials. Marble Berriez stands for timeless, elegant designs in exclusive, colorful prints. 100% sustainable
Marble Berriez's clothing is completely sustainable. For the dresses, we choose 100% Tencel, the most environmentally friendly fabric and a ""rising star"" among sustainable designers. Even the zippers and buttons are made from recycled materials, namely recycled post-consumer polyester and hemp.

Tencel clothing
Tencel is not that well known yet, but it is a really great invention! It is made from wood pulp from eucalyptus forests that are sustainably managed. Tencel's production process is a ‘closed-loop’. This means that more than 99% of the water and solvents used in the process are collected and reused. The bleaching of the fibers is done chlorine-free, which makes Tencel completely biodegradable.

So, Tencel scores high on sustainability. But that's not all; it is also a beautiful fabric with special properties:
It is very soft, which ensures comfort, but it is also strong and can take a beating.
The fabric breathes, which is pleasant in both winter and summer.
Tencel absorbs water better than cotton but still dries faster.
It shrinks and creases less than cotton.

Made in the Netherlands
Marble Berriez products are produced in the Netherlands. In this way, we minimize transport and thus our CO2-footprint. The fabrics are printed with unique patterns exclusively for Marble Berriez. This is done at a Dutch textile printing company that digitally prints with GOTS ink (Global Organic Textile Standard). The clothing is made in a Dutch sewing workshop, a beautiful family business that has been in business for 35 years! So you can be sure that the dress you will be wearing is produced fairly and with great craftmanship.

Marcia de Carvalho,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Footwear', 'Bags', 'Accessories', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: Marcia de Carvalho DESCRIPTION: Glamorous and ecological fashion: a unique concept!

Do you want fashion that doesn't sacrifice style and respects the environment?

Chaussettes Orphelines offers you socks, clothing and accessories that allow you to combine style and values: all our collections are made from recycling, and not just any socks: sock recycling!! We are campaigning for ethical fashion that preserves natural resources!

The bottom line:
- The manufacture of a garment (and therefore of a sock) is polluting.

Cotton production depletes our water reserves. A pair of 60 g cotton socks requires 1350 litres of water, or more than 20 showers!

20% of the world's water pollution comes from textiles, due to dyes.

- The end of life of an item of clothing (and therefore of a sock) is polluting.

90% of used or orphan socks are thrown in the trash.

With an annual consumption of 300 million pairs of socks in France, that's 16,000 tons of waste. The equivalent of 16,000 cars that we would scrap!

Our solution: use what already exists! Recycle!

The most environmentally friendly textiles are the ones we don't produce!

Margon Metamorfosi,['Womenswear'],"BRAND: Margon Metamorfosi DESCRIPTION: Audacious, bold and determined but at the same time free-thinking, imaginative and original, highly sophisticated, intellectual and seemingly aloof. This is the Metamorfosi woman.

She chooses each garment not only for its purely functional reasons but also for the meaning it takes on in the eternal relationship between concept and form, wisely selecting from a wardrobe not filled with clothes but filled with a series of states, moments and circumstances. It is this woman that inspires our design team season after season. Keeping in mind every time we create a Metamorfosi piece that while it is true that clothes help to make personality, it is equally true that personality makes fashion, therefore clothes.

Innovative silhouettes sculpted in materials that look rough but are actually supple to the touch. Cold lunar colors brought to life by the warmest of accents in a new and modern type of harmony.

The collection as a whole speaks the language of modernity, of uniqueness and exclusivity, responding to the needs of the women who choose it. The same is true for each single garment which, even when isolated from its context, communicates its own unique identity and claims its own distinct place within the fashion universe.

Through the careful and timely research for new materials, expert knowledge of tailoring and precision production – all of which are “100% Made in Italy” – each piece of Metamorfosi clothing comes into being. Hand-dying printing techniques executed by expert fabric painters give each garment an original twist, transforming them into one-of-a-kind pieces.

Underneath all this is a long tradition of tailoring, in which a drive towards excellence, respect for human values and a deep passion carried from generation to generation work in harmony.

Marinepool,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Footwear', 'Bags', 'Kidswear']","BRAND: Marinepool DESCRIPTION: About the joy of sailing - or how to turn your hobby into your job which - well - does not allow you time for your hobby any longer.

The friendship between sailing mates formed the basis for the establishment of a company in 1991. Ambiciously, the friends chose the globe for their logo, clearly indicating their goal of building an international brand. The three guys from Munich took up the challenge and what seemed tilting at windmills in early days turned into a success story. The company and the Marinepool brand grew and went international. The global success of Marinepool can be attributed to several factors. One element are the three founders, whose totally different characters complement each other. Different points of view and approaches focused on a common goal are key to success. The support of countless friends, yacht clubs, sailing federations and world class athletes from all over the world is another vital part. Last but not least, the most important success factor is the Marinepool team. Our staff that lives our spirit and who are the soul of Marinepool. Without their commitment, loyalty and their drive Marinepool would not be where we are today.

We came a long way from a small importer of deck shoes to one of the leading sailing clothing and life jacket brands and successful maritime lifestyle label. We are proud of what we achieved and of our story.

Our customer's enthusiasm for the collections is the greatest motivation to set the bar ever higher and develop even more innovative and functional products in which our clients take pleasure every day, no matter whether they are exercising water sports or are lost in thoughts about our shared passion.

We want to continue along this successful path - hobby or job, job or hobby, the journey is the reward.

Marita Moreno,"['Footwear', 'Bags', 'Accessories', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: Marita Moreno DESCRIPTION: Marita Moreno is a sustainable Portuguese brand of fashion accessories created with a unique and ethical perspective, in which the history of the products is fundamental for its definition as a ""slow fashion"" brand. Our products use local and national endogenous resources, artisanal and industrial. We are constantly in search of how to create and produce design objects with history that are used in everyday life. Ethics, transparency in production and social responsibility have always been intrinsic values to the brand. From the beginning, with the creation of limited lines, the use of national raw materials, production in Portugal and the integration of traditional handcrafted textiles in our products, we began to look at our environmental responsibility as a company and the importance of producing in a sustainable way. Since the introduction of the vegan line, we have started to go further and make a careful choice of the sustainable materials we use in our products, furthering our intention to change mentalities through a more conscious consumption with the environment and our role in the world we live in.

​We care about the creative process and our models are made to last. We use quality materials based on the principles of sustainability when producing our products for greater durability of the items and we add a timeless design that avoids fashion trends which would imply shorter life cycles to the products.

We work with a craftsman who made our handmade bags, with certified artisans who made handmade weaving especially for our brand, and with a small family factory. We have a close relationship with the suppliers who provide the raw material we use to make our products.

Marita Moreno operates according to the collective bargaining agreement - fulfilling all the payments to the state, including social security, finances and taxes - and the ACT (Authority for Working Conditions). We only work with companies that follow and respect the rules imposed by the Portuguese State, with regard to job security, social security and finances.

Our commitment as a company is to use sustainable and ecological practices in the corporate culture within Marita Moreno, thus minimizing the impacts generated in the environment from economic activities as well as alert people to the way they consume, change habits and mentalities.

Marjana von Berlepsch,"['Bags', 'Jewelry']","BRAND: Marjana von Berlepsch DESCRIPTION: Stylish, cool and fashion-conscious, MARJANA VON BERLEPSCH presents a new collection for Autumn/ Winter 2019, in which each piece has the potential to become a personal favourite. The German designer's name stands for fabulously casual jewellery, whose statement is to emphasise the wearer's attitude to life. With gently dosed edginess she gives him that special kick. Collection after collection MARJANA VON BERLEPSCH seamlessly follows the previous one, while colours and materials correspond to the current mood. Bracelets, bracelets set with balls - and above all necklaces - prove that elegance actually consists in omitting superfluous things. From neck-hugging to extra-long, they underline the looks of the season, but always exude the lightness of being that we all long for now.

MARJANA VON BERLEPSCH probably succeeds so well in feeling the feeling of life of the coming season because she originally started her career as a fashion editor for Vogue and Harper´s Bazaar. In 2003, she founded her own label and quickly established herself as a star of the young Jewellry scene. ""Styling options are especially important to me,"" says the jeweller. ""Necklaces of different lengths can replace scarves, for example. Their strong effect is based on an interesting mix of materials: leather in combination with precious stones, metals or horn, for example. Letter chains and bracelets allow their owners to express themselves precisely and individually. Plate chains can be perfectly combined with other designs. Yellow or pink gold flatters the eye and the skin.

""It is important to me that my line looks very light and casual, despite its solid craftsmanship,"" says MARJANA VON BERLEPSCH. So-called signature looks underline the market value of large companies. I, on the other hand, believe in expressive, smart parts that can be combined again and again.""",https://www.marjanavonberlepsch.com,"{'neg': 0.005, 'neu': 0.806, 'pos': 0.189, 'compound': 0.9957}",0.9957,Positive,en

Marlies Dekkers,"['Bodywear', 'Swimwear']","BRAND: Marlies Dekkers DESCRIPTION: Marlies Dekkers (Elisabeth Maria Johanna Dekkers, Oosterhout, 29 november 1965) is a famous Dutch lingerie designer. She has achieved international success with her lingerie designs. As the pioneer of the trend 'innerwear as outerwear' Marlies Dekkers has proven her versatility without a doubt. Her designs are seen nationally and internationally as trendsetting, innovative and pioneering. Marlies Dekkers has changed the world of lingerie for good with her inspiring designs and personal philosophy. All her designs are inspired by her own vision on life, and she wants to give women more self confidence. For the spring|summer ’22 collection, marlies|dekkers returns to the womb of Mother Earth to honor all her marvelous creations and celebrate the miracle of life. Mother Earth made first herself in the manifestation as a formidable Greek goddess - literally becoming the first self-made woman! - after which she birthed the earth and all its wild beauty. The ultimate source of raw, maternal power was worshipping in caves and by springs where her life-giving water burst forth like milk from breasts or menstrual blood. The Greeks called her Gaia: the one we are born from and fed by and the one we return to when we die. The original Big Mama.

Marlies designed for this spring|summer a couture collection, style collection, and swimwear collection. She had an eye for detail for every piece, which you can find back in every collection. With a theme as Mother Earth and the current time we live in, we find it essential to look at more sustainable ways to produce our collection. We printed, for instance, our Couture collection digitally, which saves water, and used recycled polyamide fabric for this collection. Digital textile printing saves 40-50 liters of water per meter, making the Gaia collection a treat for both your curves and your conscience! 

For the lingerie collection, it’s all about the details. You will find unique details in every collection, from our in-house designed ornaments to the woven statements on the straps and bindings. Our signature statement straps can be found the collections and are loved since the first time Marlies used these in her collections. 

Our spring|summer’22 swimwear collection is one of our most extensive swim collections of all time. With more shapes for every body type. Marlies redesigned her best-selling collections for this season: Cache Coeur, Panthera, and Star Coral. Most collections will have a high waist brief, and we see that this shape is very popular for women on the beach and makes women feel comfortable; just like in our lingerie collection, we looked at more sustainable ways to produce this collection. Where possible, our production team created it most sustainably, from recycled yarn to digital printing.

MASKA,"['Womenswear', 'Accessories', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: MASKA DESCRIPTION: YOU CAN’T TELL HOW QUICKLY SOMETHING IS MADE. ONLY HOW WELL.
MASKA is dedicated to creating exceptional clothes where yarn, fabric and design come together in perfect harmony. Each MASKA garment is crafted from natural fibers, carefully selected for their lasting beauty. The brand was founded on the Swedish west coast in 2009 by Maria Svensson and launched a year later. The mission for the founder managed company was clear: to design relevant, quality garments that transcend the seasons and to produce them in a sustainable way. The company is independent and family owned. The brand’s designs are now available at about 55 stockists in Europe, Asia and North America, and appreciated by web customers all over the world.

A LABEL COMMITTED TO QUALITY AND TIMELESSNESS.
The creation of MASKA springs from a vision of a high-quality brand that combines luxury fibers and refined, scandinavian aesthetics. In a small sewing mill in a Swedish town famous for its textile industry, MASKA’s founder Maria Svensson used to run around playing with threads and textile leftovers gathered from the floor at her grandmother's’ feet. The mill was run by her grandmother and her great grandmother, who taught her about true quality and workmanship behind the products. With traditions going back to the sewing mill, the idea of using exquisite yarns, fabrics and elaborate structures, as well as applying artisanal knitting techniques, is the brand’s solid platform.

Sustainable material and production choices have been a matter of course from the very beginning, as well as keeping a high design profile. The designs might appear simple at first, but include subtle details and materials that balance simplicity with complexity. This balance ensures that one does not tire of the garment but constantly finds new meanings and enriched beauty that make the aesthetic value grow with time. The quality materials are chosen to create sensual and longer lasting garments through which the brand has gained a strong following among people who favour a timeless self-expression.

Maven Women,['Womenswear'],"BRAND: Maven Women DESCRIPTION: We are based in Washington, DC and highly engage women across ages and professions in our design process. Over 100 women across a range of builds, ages, and professions have been intimately involved in developing our styles. We know the biggest frustrations of women with their day-to-evening pieces, why some women love pockets and others don't, and their favorite design details. This is not a static but ongoing process and we always welcome your feedback, as you'll see in our customer service. Women aren't built like mannequins or hangers, and most women have different builds than runway models. Our founder's background in figure drawing and her bodily changes during pregnancy and post-partum heavily influence our design process. Yes, our designs look great on the runway, but they look even better on you.

Many conventional fashion brands fit clothing on one fit model and then ""grade"" it up and down to make it fit different sizes. This is why you find so many pieces with too large or too small armholes, wonky torso and skirt lengths, odd puckering, and more. We used a double digit number of real women across ages and builds to finalize our size chart and fit. We also always consider the natural bodily fluctuations of women and how their bodies change over time.

Metisse,['Footwear'],"BRAND: Metisse DESCRIPTION: Almost half a century of love for footwear
At the age of 6, Umberto Pezzella worked as a small helper in a shoe factory, and then, as a teenager, he began to work as a miller (a profession that was extinguished with the introduction of molded soles). In 1973, buying a few machines in installments, he founded a small shop. Together with his wife Raffaela he also works 16 hours a day, managing to produce a small production of high quality women's shoes.

In the 1980s the Pezzella reality experienced a notable development, up to becoming a small workshop equipped with a conveyor system where the various workers are articulated.

In 1998, with the introduction of the children, the current business reality was born.

Today the Fratelli Pezzella shoe factory produces shoes with the highest quality standards, respecting all the strict criteria of 100% made in Italy, exporting its creations almost all over the world.

Present at all editions of MICAM in Milan, at Who's Next in Paris and at Expo Riva Schuh in Riva del Garda.

Métissé,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Métissé DESCRIPTION: Métissé is a Parisian Brand founded in 2019 by Marius Sebille, a cosmopolitan stylist and lawyer. During his trip in the USA, he understood the necessity of a french streetwear brand which should focus on quality and responsibility. 

Half Venezuelian and half French, he created a brand that will take the opposite of the identity withdrawal by sublimating the interbreeding. Parisian by adoption, he only collaborates with french artists, stylists and photographer  to highlight Parisian talents Before graduate in a Law school in 2019, he chose to create unique hand painted jackets which were handmade in Paris. This project was his first brand « Boulevard des péchés » which was the foundation of his knowledge about the fashion industry.

He knew that the painted handmade jackets won’t be able to flourish in this industry. Therefore, he chose to focus on streetwear by presenting his interbreeding version on it. He first started with a first collection  « galactic impact », launched at the end of 2019, highlighting the cultural bridge between the manga’s culture and his youth. He found an ethical Portuguese supplier and a Parisian serigraph to help him in launching this collection of his fresh new brand « Métissé ».

Then, shocked by the violence of the French Government during the Epidemic crisis and the recurrent attacks against the French youth, he decided to collaborate with the 9 artist lab, a group of Parisian talented artists, to criticize what they saw during the covid crisis.

As a result, they created a new collection « Ensauvagement », an artistic manifesto which depicts the mental state of the young society in the aftermath of the health crisis.

Milliana,"['Accessories', 'Jewelry']","BRAND: Milliana DESCRIPTION: SHARMILLA & ARIANNA = MILLIANNA

MILLIANNA is the creation of Sharmilla Persaud and Arianna Brooke.  Friends since 1995, they met while working at BCBG Max Azria, where Sharmilla worked in design and Arianna worked in the marketing department. “We knew that we always wanted to start something together and we saw that there was an opportunity in the market for our vision of fashion jewelry,” says Arianna. The friends joined professional forces in 2010 to create MILLIANNA. Drawing upon their professional experience, Sharmilla and Arianna approach jewelry design from the perspective of fashion rather than accessory trends. Their unique interpretation of pop culture and fashion is infused with inspiration from historical eras such as Elizabethan England and various art movements, like Art Deco. “Our pieces are sophisticated and statement driven, reflecting a woman’s inner beauty and confidence,” says Sharmilla, “and that’s sexy.” MILLIANNA accessories appeal to a broad range of women, from young fashionistas to established jewelry and fashion connoisseurs, such as Iris Apfel. What these women have in common is a strong love of fashion and great sense of confidence.

Combining form with function, one of the most unique elements of MILLIANNA’s pieces is the closure used on all the cuffs and many necklaces. It is magnetic, lined with leather and topped with either hand-painted python skin or stamped lambskin. “It makes putting pieces on and taking them off very easy as well as comfortable,” says Arianna, “and because they’re so beautiful, many of our customers wear our cuffs with the closure showing on top of their wrists!”

While Sharmilla drives design, Arianna oversees production in her hometown of Spokane, WA. Each piece is intricately handmade by skilled artisans in the U.S. “It was really important to us to keep production here. Doing so allows us to focus more on design while maintaining speed-to-market,” says Arianna. As all of the pieces are labor-intensive, quality is immensely important and each piece is painstakingly inspected upon completion. Many of the artisans who work with MILLIANNA are immigrant women who arrived in Spokane with the World Relief Organization. MILLIANNA is proud to support this organization and these determined women. “MILLIANNA is an American, female-owned company that makes products for women by women,” says Sharmilla, “We partner with so many talented and interesting people-it’s a lot of what makes our work so gratifying.”      

Fashion and design fascinated Sharmilla from an early age. As a teenager she was known for pulling off savvy and daring outfits, and for stealing away to off-Broadway shows in her hometown of NYC. She pursued her love of fashion at the Fashion Institute of Technology where she earned her degree in Design. After graduation, Max Azria hired her as a designer at BCBG where she excelled at creating fabric trends. Her wholehearted belief in the quality of certain fabrics often convinced even the most skeptical to invest in her vision, with great success. She brings this intuition to MILLIANNA, where she especially enjoys the creative process from first imagining a concept to the physical production of the design. She finds inspiration in fashion designers such as Coco Chanel and Elsa Schiaparelli.

Arianna was indelibly influenced by her childhood summers spent in Italy. There she was exposed to the mélange of old and new: the crumbling architecture and fine paintings of Italy melded with innovative fashion trends, years ahead of their American counterparts. Her fascination with Italian design, as well as her love of the vibrant colors and sculptural form of the ‘80s fashion trends, led her to develop an interest in fashion. Arianna turned her interest in fashion into a career, working first at BCBG Max Azria and later at The Sak as vice president of marketing. Arianna observed how the creative and structural can work together to create a unique product, and has used this philosophy at MILLIANNA.

MINI A TURE,"['Kidswear', 'Bodywear', 'Swimwear', 'Accessories', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: MINI A TURE DESCRIPTION: We had a dream when my husband, two friends and I launched MINI A TURE in 2002. A dream and an ambition to create a high-quality fashion brand for children with a unique design, innovative technology, and the best materials to create a brand that is much more than just children's clothing. My husband and I have three children: two girls in their early 20s and an 11-year-old boy. Our children today live very differently than they did in the past, and many are spending more and more time on indoor pursuits and digital media. We want to help teach our children to take care of nature and help them feel at home in it. With the right clothing, we are sure that most children can learn to love nature regardless of the season and weather and get a desire to spend quality time in it by themselves and with their loved ones.

We believe that children should be free, confident, and happy. They must have the freedom to stand by themselves and have the courage and strength to stand up for others. Freedom to move effortlessly through life and playfully embrace the world with an open mind. All children must be recognized as the unique human-being they each are, and they must have faith in themselves. Small is Free.

We are inspired by children's imagination. Their sense of creativity and their authentic curiosity about life. Their way of creating astonishing universes and stories that do not always make sense to adults.

With MINI A TURE, we want children to express themselves in their very own way. We do not compromise on either trends or freedom of movement. The very small details count. Small is cool.

With our Scandinavian roots, we know how changing weather conditions require appropriate clothing. From the magical, bright, and warm summer days to the cozy, cold and dark winter evenings - our children must always be dressed to meet the world. Small is Adventurous.

We value honesty, responsibility, and thorough work. All our suppliers and resellers are carefully selected according to their commitment to quality and craftsmanship as well as their assurance of proper working conditions for all employees.

We cherish the memories of childhood, the scratched knees, the smell of playhouse and the feeling of delicate falling snowflakes melting on the tongue. Small is Imaginative.

The dream has come true.

Mini Rodini,['Kidswear'],"BRAND: Mini Rodini DESCRIPTION: Mini Rodini is a Swedish children’s wear brand that was founded in 2006 by illustrator Cassandra Rhodin as a tribute to all children, their imagination and sense that everything is possible. Mini Rodini takes children seriously with playfulness, meaning it is important that children too have clothes that match their own personality, mood and creativity. Mini Rodini’s vision has always been to make it both easy and exciting for parents to buy better products for their kids in regards to the design as well as environmental and ethical aspects of the production. And while the playful and humorous aesthetics may speak directly to the children, the quality of the products is equally important. A Mini Rodini garment is not only fun to wear or just look at, but is also produced in a way that is kinder to the environment and the people behind it.

Ever since the start, Mini Rodini has been a true success story. When the first collection of cotton prints was released in a few selected Stockholm shops 2006, it sold out almost immediately. Everything happened very quickly and what started with tons of boxes stacked in Cassandra’s apartment in Stockholm shortly became an independent shop just a block away. Mini Rodini soon became darlings of the press both in Sweden and internationally for their unique interpretation of children’s clothes. With a combination of excellent quality and quirky design, Mini Rodini creates clothes that parents want to dress their kids in, and that kids love to wear.

Today, Mini Rodini is one of Scandinavia’s fastest growing children’s wear brands. Selling in some of the most prestigious department stores and independent shops all around the world, from Harvey Nichols in Kuwait, Selfridges in London and Barneys in New York. As of now, Mini Rodini is represented in over 500 selected locations aside from the three fully owned stores in Stockholm, one store in Gothenburg, one store in Malmö, one store in London and an online shop that ships world-wide.

Since its conception, Molo has seen its role as the brand that provides “favourites” for every child’s closet.      
                                                                                                       
Molo’s first collection, 2-8 years, sees the light of day in the spring of 2003 and is initially sold in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Holland, and England. But the Molo customer isn’t satisfied because they want more: so the first Molo baby collection, 0-2 years, launches in 2005, and in 2009 the first separate outwear collection makes its debut. Since then, Molo has seen its product range grow to include boys’ and girls’ collections up to 16 years, as well as a swimwear collection. Wholesale

Montce,"['Womenswear', 'Swimwear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Montce DESCRIPTION: A South Florida native, Alexandra Grief used her creativity and ingenuity to turn her side hustle into an international brand. With few resources, she started making swimwear in 2009 from her Fort Lauderdale apartment, where friends and customers stopped by for a curated, custom swimwear look that was made to order.

In 2013, Ali opened the first Montce store in Ft. Lauderdale. The second-floor showroom had no street visibility, but it did have a homey charm that felt like an extension of the designer’s studio/store/apartment. Customers — obsessed with Montce's flawless fit — were more than happy to head there for their bikini fix, and the South Florida swimwear hidden gem would not remain a secret spot for long. As the business (and buzz) kept picking up, Ali’s brother and business partner Devin quit his accounting job in NYC. Devin — transitioning from finance to fashion — started working in a multifaceted role at Montce, even filling in for sales associates in the Fort Lauderdale store.  Like all successful business partners, the siblings' skill sets are complimentary, with Devin now the COO and Co-CEO and Ali Creative Director and Co-CEO. While the days of Ali and Devin working in-store and overseeing every detail are long gone (they now rely on their invaluable 40+ person team), it's still very much a family business.     

Today, in addition to a new Ft. Lauderdale location, there's a Montce store in Hermosa Beach and a Miami Design District location, plus it's sold at over 70 stockists worldwide. It's also been featured in top publications including Vogue and Marie Claire, and worn by celebrities including Kendall Jenner, Priyanka Chopra, Chrissy Teigen, Jennifer Lopez, and Emily Ratajkowski. 

Despite the fast growth, Montce's formula for success has remained the same since day one. Quality fabrics, nostalgic prints, and advanced construction details make each bikini stand out, and extensive fit testing and quality control ensures that they're both flattering and comfortable. This effortless blend of style and substance, combined with an obsessive focus on fit, is what sets Montce apart — and why their customers only shop Montce once they’ve tried on the brand.

Modern Bohemian Lifestyle Brand with a touch of rebellion
MOOST & The Muse by MOOST Wanted is a modern bohemian lifestyle brand with a touch of rebellion. It all began 10 years ago when owner Marinka Oostveen traveled to San Francisco. The creative vibe of the city inspired her to dream. Finally back in Amsterdam she started to listen to her innervoice and MOOST Wanted was born. Our new brand name
We are currently in the process of transitioning our brand name from MOOST Wanted to MOOST & The Muse. We created our brand name over ten years ago and we think our new name fits more by our sharpened vision. We have already made the change digitally, and are currently in the final stages of rolling out the rebrand for our packaging and garment tags. As part of our sustainability values, we are aiming to minimize the need to destroy existing tags. So that's why you can possibly see different logos and names on your packages or on our clothing labels.
 
We can say it has been a great and inspiring journey this far. MOOST & THE MUSE by MOOST Wanted still has lots of dreams to accomplish and we hope you are with us during every step we take. Take a look around and get inspired on our social channels Instagram and Facebook.
 
Rewiring. Relearning. Rewilding.

MOROBÉ,"['Womenswear', 'Footwear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: MOROBÉ DESCRIPTION: As a little girl, Virginie Morobé donned her school’s drab, grey uniform without thinking twice about it. It was the blandness of the shoes that hit her where it hurt. For years, shoe shopping sprees ended in tears, as every immaculately-placed flower, print, or applique on a forbidden shoe made her swoon.

Years later, she found the ultimate redemption: she launched her own high-end shoe label. Based in Antwerp, Belgium's fashion capital, MOROBÉ is nothing less than an exuberant celebration of Virginie's passion for shoes, craftsmanship, and exquisite design. Don't expect a simple sneaker to carry her signature, though. MOROBÉ is all about contemporary elegance and powerful femininity, merging the purism of the old Italian masters with today's brazenness and technological advances. 

Virginie's creative process is a direct manifestation of her personal development and growth.

""While designing, I remain very aware of my inner self. My gut instinct is my North Star. I know that this is what I was born to do; it's both my purpose and my play.”

Muchachomalo,"['Bodywear', 'Swimwear']","BRAND: Muchachomalo DESCRIPTION: As a young lingerie retailer, Shirley Schoonebeek owned several stores in the city centre of Amsterdam, and one at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. After a few years entrenched in the industry, she was in search of a brand with a story – something to talk about, think about – something that stood out from the ordinary. When she couldn’t find it, she fearlessly decided to create her own. Not one to follow trends, she took conscious action to create unique prints in collaboration with real artists; to develop a label that would appeal to guys who embrace their inner “Bad Boy”. This cooperation resulted in the striking brand as we know it today. Muchachomalo is growing and innovating in the field of materials and fit, woven through a collection that is becoming more and more extensive in designs and colours.

The Muchachomalo cannot be caught in one man. It is a wild character that is hidden in several men. Muchachomalos are of all ages. Come in different shapes. But they do have a number of things in common… The Muchachomalo is authentic. His inner-rebel walks the line between being naughty and playful. He is confident. Knows his mind. Focused on reaching his goals, he does not shy away from risks. As a natural leader, his ideas and enthusiasm resonate with others. He works hard and blows off steam on adventure weekends. He’s rarely alone. Friends appreciate him for his courage and honesty. Women find him desperately appealing. He is charming. Takes care of himself. Is fit. Self-assured. He is independent and a bit mysterious. The Muchachomalo man inspires and surprises. And like most men, he never ‘really’ grows up…that little ‘Bad Boy’ sparkle is never far from the surface.

MUD Jeans,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Denim']","BRAND: MUD Jeans DESCRIPTION: MUD Jeans is the first circular denim brand in the world. The company is on a mission to prove the world that jeans can be made circular. MUD Jeans stand for minimum depletion of resources and maximum re-use. By offering jeans that look good and that are recycled eternally, the brand cuts down on water, CO2 and fully eliminates waste. In 2012 Bert van Son founded the company. His 30 years’ experience in the fashion industry made him realise how dirty and unfair the industry is most of the time. He has witnessed that life for factory workers is extremely demanding, and that it makes great demands of nature. And decided this was something he wanted to change. Together with his team, Bert transformed MUD Jeans into an exemplary company, consistently putting circular economy principles into practice. At the moment the brand already uses 40% post-consumer recycled cotton in their jeans. Together with Saxion University and Circle Economy new techniques are developed to make the first jeans from 100% recycled denim.

MUD Jeans aims to make good quality, ethical jeans available to more people. The jeans hit about every box on the ethical checklis (vegan, fair, GOTS), but wants to take it one step further. In 2013, MUD Jeans launched the pioneering Lease A Jeans system. This system ensures that MUD Jeans keeps hold of the valuable fibres and that every garment comes back to get recycled. In the near future, the lease system will be available for retailers. Giving stores the possibility to offer every pair of the MUD Jeans collection for lease, while not having to stock the full range of products.

Transparency is key to MUD Jeans. Together with Ecochain a Life Cycle Assessment was conducted. Compared to industry standards MUD Jeans saves 92% water, 67% CO2 and 49% Land Use. As a frontrunner in circular denim the brand shared their practices in an extended Sustainability Report. https://bit.ly/32RoDpL

MUD Jeans is a Certified B Corp since 2014, ranking in the top 5 highest B Corps in the Netherlands. In October 2020 MUD Jeans was awarded as Sustainable Retailer of the Year.

MUJI,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Kidswear', 'Bodywear', 'Footwear', 'Jewelry', 'Bags', 'Accessories']","BRAND: MUJI DESCRIPTION: MUJI was founded in Japan in 1980 as an antithesis to the habits of consumer society at that time. On one hand, foreign-made luxury brands were gaining popularity within an economic environment of ever-rising prosperity. On the other, poor-quality, low-priced goods were appearing on the market, and had a polarizing effect on consumption patterns. MUJI was conceived as a critique of this prevailing condition, with the purpose of restoring a vision of products that are actually useful for the customer and maintain an ideal of the proper balance between living and the objects that make it possible. The concept was born of the intersection of two distinct stances: no brand (Mujirushi) and the value of good items (ryohin). MUJI began with three steps: selecting materials, scrutinizing processes, and simplifying packaging. MUJI’s concept of emphasizing the intrinsic appeal of an object through rationalization and meticulous elimination of excess is closely connected to the traditionally Japanese aesthetic of “su” –– meaning plain or unadorned –– the idea that simplicity is not merely modest or frugal, but could possibly be more appealing than luxury.",https://www.mujionline.eu/uk/,"{'neg': 0.008, 'neu': 0.902, 'pos': 0.089, 'compound': 0.8847}",0.8847,Positive,en

My Favorite Piece,['Jewelry'],"BRAND: My Favorite Piece DESCRIPTION: JEWELERY CAN BE AN ETHICAL CHOICE
In My Favorite Piece, garbage is not garbage but valuable material. The entire company's operations, from the manufacture of jewelery to packaging, mailing, display and maintenance, are based on the recycling of already existing “old” materials. This recycling chain is made possible by e.g. cooperation with local companies whose activities generate this “rubbish”. In all its operations, the company strives for the principle of zero waste, both in the use of materials and energy consumption. Jewelry is also made from the “waste” of other jewelry. Product design is careful and often rotating a stencil with a piece of leather to ensure maximum utilization sometimes takes longer than manufacturing the product.

Our lamp shines and the sewing machine rumbles with green energy. We recycle business waste if it happens to be…

The main material of the jewelry is leather waste. It can be an old leather suitcase or leather jacket, furniture factory cutting waste or a deliciously colored surplus piece from European tanneries. Our partner factories are in Spain and Italy. They make and dye skins and cut them for artisans esm. for the manufacture of shoes and bags. The pieces of waste are collected in sacks, which are sold at a price per kilo. In practice, the sack is always a surprise bag for us.
Skins obtained through private donors are often accompanied by funny stories. They can be souvenirs, momentary deviations, surprises found in closet wigs, or treasures passed from mother to daughter. Stories change and continue to live in a new form in our jewelry.
Other materials include plexiglass lenses that come through a recycling collaboration pattern from eyeglass manufacturers. We also use non-pledged recycled plastic e.g. cosmetics, arch supports and other recycled plastic and metal parts, as well as pistachio shells.
We work with the local Sea Lapland Day Spa company precisely with the plastic in the cosmetics packaging. We make jewelry from plastic waste generated by the company's operations. You can find cooperation products on the sealaplanddayspa.fi website.

The online store's deliveries go to the customer in recycled cardboard packaging with reusable tissue paper and bubble wrap. Jewelry cardboard is recycled. These all come from our partner company Subway clothing Kemi and are recyclable. The small plastic bags for jewelry plugs that come with your order are recycled, as is the care leaflet. We hurry to deliveries to Posti by foot.

MYoMY bags are recognizable by their elegant simplicity and enduring quality.

All bags and wallets are made of Leather Working Group certified leather, which means that the leather is tanned in a sustainable way: with less chromium and as few chemicals as possible to keep the water purification pure.

MYoMY products facilitate fair trade jobs that ensure artisans of a fair income, acceptable working times, safe working conditions and access to training and personal development. While economic freedom can change a lot we also believe that we can do more than that on an emotional level. To enable real change we search for real connections in our collaborations. With people that want to inspire others in order to dream, take action, learn and grow.

The designer Natalia Berilo is inspired by the geometric shapes that nature takes, timeless disruptive creations, for demanding clients who appreciate unique, sophisticated and avant-garde objects, and value fashion as a functional work of art that accompanies us in our day to day. Following a philosophy of slow fashion, all our designs are made by hand in Ubrique, a Spanish town with a long tradition in the leather sector. Our artisans make each piece with high quality standards. Natalia Berilo relates that: “In architecture, design and engineering, the human being has replicated nature, if we observe carefully, in each step we take through our cities, nature appears to us in all its forms, sets of solid juxtaposed that gives as a result those streets and buildings through which we travel daily.

Without realizing it, we live immersed in a replica of nature and no matter how much we believe that within a city we are far from it, everything that surrounds us has its shape and soul. Isn’t the human being a product of nature? Seen like this, it is not surprising that all art and all our creations contain it.
Minerals, in their crystallization, show us infinite geometric shapes, and it is there, in the hexagonal crystallization of the mineral Beryl, where I have found much of my inspiration”.

Natventure,['Accessories'],"BRAND: Natventure DESCRIPTION: SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS INSTEAD OF DAMAGING BULK GOODS

With the use of cork leather , we are relying on a  resource-saving and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional leather. Cork oaks produce around 700 kg of cork in their lifetime , from which around  12,000 cork wallets can be made. Cork oaks are the only trees whose bark can be removed without harming the tree. NATURAL MATERIAL WITH A POSITIVE ECOBALANCE

With cork leather, we use a renewable raw material that offers real added value for nature. Peeled cork oaks bind up to 4 times more CO² than conventional trees and thus ensure a positive ecological balance. Due to the careful handling, the cork oaks live to be 100 to 300 years old and thus help to keep our air clean.

OUR PRODUCTION

Behind every step of our production chain there is the work of individual people. For us, sustainability not only means ecological materials, but also fair working and production conditions.

Neil Barrett,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Kidswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Neil Barrett DESCRIPTION: Neil Barrett founded his eponymous brand in 1999, debuting on the runway in 2000, at Pitti Uomo, Florence. Ever since, Neil Barrett has delivered innovative and distinctive designs, with acute attention to fabric development and fits.

The hallmarks of the Neil Barrett label are a modern interpretation of a daily uniform, alongside striking, streamlined styling for the twenty-first century. Masculine, ageless and wearable, Neil Barrett designs combine precisely-cut tailoring, accurate detailing and athletic elements, covering a wide spectrum of fits to cater to the diversity of international markets while maintaining the sharp silhouette the Brand stands for.

In 2006 Neil Barrett expanded into womenswear with the same clean, contemporary outlook. The collections offer women the same bespoke-quality finish, handcraft and luxurious textile as his menswear collections, alongside Neil Barrett's trademark purity. In 2009, instead of investing in retail stores, Neil Barrett chose to strengthen the very heart of the brand by creating a production division based in Tuscany, from where all sampling, production and distribution are currently coordinated. In countertrend with most fashion houses, 85% of the collections are, actually, Made in Italy. Moreover, the decision to independently reinvest in the production platforms - without a financial backer - coincided with a continued belief in focusing on Italian fabrics mills, new technologies and artisan producers.

2011 began with the strengthening of distribution: a Neil Barrett boutique opened in Landmark, Hong Kong, shortly followed by two mono-brand openings in Seoul, South Korea. Recently, Neil Barrett opened boutiques in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou and Macau, continuing the partnership with architect Zaha Hadid for the store-concepts.

Since the birth of the Brand, celebrities - with Brad Pitt at the forefront - have appreciated the modernity of Neil Barrett collections. Throughout the years, the label became a favourite of Ewan McGregor, Mark Ruffalo, Orlando Bloom, Jamie Dornan, and Justin Timberlake, who wore an exclusive Neil Barrett wardrobe throughout the “The 20/20 Experience Tour”.

New Amsterdam Surf,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear']","BRAND: New Amsterdam Surf DESCRIPTION: Amsterdam based founder and former professional windsurfer Paul Zeper (28) first learned how to windsurf at the age of 14 under typical Dutch weather conditions. 

Unlike the tropical settings usually associated with surfing, Paul and his surf crew are used to mostly dealing with brown waters, muddy coastlines, cold water temperatures and lots of wind, but it will never withhold them from practicing the sport they love most. To the contrary, they like the way these conditions leave room for only those who are truly passionate about surfing, no matter the circumstances. While learning to become a graphic designer, Paul organically started to combine his two passions and began to work on his very own surf brand. The idea of New Amsterdam Surf Association was born, now resulting in a range of clothes that represent a counter movement within the established surf culture. This shows in rigid colour ways and clean graphics, making its wearers feel united in their collectively shared passion and perseverance.

Born in Estonia, NOP feels nature in its bones. We acknowledge the raw truth: there is no future without sustainable people doing sustainable things and living a sustainable life.

We believe that environmental consciousness should be the new normality and that living in harmony with nature is possible. One tangible step we make is to plant a tree with each product bought. No fruit gardens but real trees in areas without any forest left. We make this happen by donating to One Tree Planted.

The bigger step is yet in our supply chain. Our products’ raw material, organic cotton, is certified and respects people and the environment. And if we don’t use raw organic cotton, we use 100% recycled materials. The inks we use are OEKO-TEX® certified which is super safe for both your skin and our planet. 

We go for the quality instead of the quantity. By treating the clothes well, you can wear your favourite Tee for years, and when it’s finally done, it’s biodegradable. And if you’ve washed it with 100% eco-friendly detergents, you can even compost it.


We love a zero-waste lifestyle.
We love both sea and earth animals.
We love biodiversity in general.
We go for equal education and rights.
We go for conscious consumption.
We are NOP!

The company is based in Los Angeles but the precious and semi-precious stones, beads, leather, and materials in the collection are handpicked by the designer on his travels around the world. With a career history with Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger, Jannik has always had a passion for style and luxury, but his many trips to the Far East are what developed and diversified his eclectic taste. Bali, Thailand, and India have become the designer’s favorite destinations for collecting inspiration, gaining insight, and rejuvenating before a new piece of jewelry comes to life. Jannik carefully searches for each precious stone, bead, and pendant that inspire him to create the next piece.  

The energy, charisma, and texture of each stone initiate the birth of a new collection. Every stone has healing powers and can amplify and increase the bearer’s own energy. Jannik has put his heart into creating pieces which promote spiritual enlightenment by being present and centered in the moment when creating a new piece of jewelry. He has worked closely with different stones and has discovered how the jewels help him gain clarity, inner peace, and joy. Upon completion, each piece is cleansed carefully with purifying sage to remove all interfering energies from the stones.

The cleansing process enhances the natural power of the stones and helps each piece of jewelry communicate better with its future owner. Nialaya carries a spiritual message to those in search of their own truth within. Each piece of jewelry is carefully strung together by hands, ensuring that the energy of the stones supports the bearer in his or her dreams.",https://www.nialaya.com,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.685, 'pos': 0.315, 'compound': 0.9988}",0.9988,Positive,en

Nice Things,"['Accessories', 'Bags', 'Footwear', 'Swimwear', 'Womenswear']","BRAND: Nice Things DESCRIPTION: Nice things was created by the couple Paloma Santaolalla and Miguel Lanna in Barcelona in 1995. The project started off in their own home, setting out to create a small and familiar fashion and accessories brand designing clothes and a unique fashion concept for creatively sensitive stylish women who appreciated attention to detail.

The concept was to create a universe where nice things happened: from living working relationships, hand drawn prints, unique color combinations, proximity to manufacturers, closeness to our clients and ethical production procedures. Here we are, 24 years later, expressing our personal outlook on how we feel things should be done and the positive things we stand up for.

This project today is run by mother and daughter, Paloma Santaolalla and Paloma Lanna, having inherited her father's drive and her mother's natural instinct in singling out uniqueness. Nice things is today an enduring project creating a universe of creativity, femininity, positivism and style.

Only using the finest fabrics and the best construction materials available to create a light and incredibly soft garment.
The history of the family business dates back to 1915 in Bitonto, the Puglia region of Italy close to Adriatic sea. The family’s roots were founded as purveyors of fine fabrics from all over Europe, but mostly Italy & England. This was an era when tailoring was a house hold staple but the clients became more interested to have their tailoring made by in the Santarelli Sartoria which only consisted of 2 tailors.
Today the family Santarelli has quietly grown to an atelier of 33 tailors and they work exclusively with the finest merchants throughout the world in a personable manner, a family way and tradition.
Nicola Santarelli is the 4th generation from the founding family members and takes great pride in the handmade culture of their namesake garment.

The handmade process starts with each pattern individually chalked & cut by hand . Whereby great consideration is given to the fabric weight, pattern & tolerance. From there, over 200 steps are masterfully hand crafted to the final stages of buttonholes sewn by hand and careful quality control. Santarelli Sartoria offers complete ready-to-wear and made-to-measure, honoring bespoke tailoring requests within 4 weeks delivery.

NIKBEN,"['Menswear', 'Womenswear', 'Swimwear']","BRAND: NIKBEN DESCRIPTION: Although born in Sweden, Nicklas aka NIK was bred on the beaches across the southern parts of Europe. Swimwear became his natural choice of apparel in his everyday life, not only for lazy days bumming on the beach, but also at the gym, relaxing at home or even on the golf course. 

Benjamin aka BEN was born on the Swedish west coast, typically spending his summers hopping from island to island on sailboats in their renowned archipelago. He would later be found at Central Saint Martins in London - surrounded with endless amounts of inspiration and creativity, he developed a vision to establish a product that would bring fashion to new dimensions. NIK and BEN crossed paths in Spain, bonded instantly, a few years onwards they decided to take destiny in their own hands - the rest is history. PHILOSOPHY
It is not a rare sight to find traditional wallpaper and flowery prints on men’s resort wear today. A classical concept that NIKBEN believes can be further developed by illustrating not only a pattern, but also a statement or an unforeseen ""twist"". NIKBEN conveys a lifestyle, the garments can be worn all year and on different occasions, not only to the beach or when on holiday. NIKBEN is not simply in the business of selling resort wear - NIKBEN sells dreams of summer, sun and happy moments.

Nioulargo,['Menswear'],"BRAND: Nioulargo DESCRIPTION: Our brand is specialized in designing and manufacturing iconic coats, jackets and accessories in a sportswear – contemporary style based on nautical heritage for passionates of such a lifestyle.

We are inspired by sailors and the waters they travel which we believe to be our passion and wish to live by.

The brand name Nioulargo finds its origin after the shallow grounds in front of the beaches of Saint Tropez. An endeavor between two yacht owners resulted in a sailing regatta from the beaches of Pampelonne, St. Tropez to the Nioulargo Shallow grounds and back. This regatta resulted in an annually held regatta of international sailing boats. The atmosphere is sportive, eclectic and inspiring. So much that we have decided to call our brand after these renowned shallow grounds and sailing regatta. The first collection has been designed for men, we have created three styles of coats in wool. The coats have been garment dyed after production which give the color and look a special effect. The coats have been tailored and manufactured in Italy. Each coat comes with an inner jacket made of teddy cotton and is reversible.

Beside the coats we have produced a line of accessories made out of 100% merino wool. The scarf, hat and gloves come in four colors and combine greatly with the coats.

We have embarked on this journey and wish to have a lot of fun doing it and mostly have our customers enjoy the clothes and accessories we provide. There is a lot more to come in the near future.

Nira Rubens,['Footwear'],"BRAND: Nira Rubens DESCRIPTION: At the beginning of 2016, from Nicoletta and Ramon's creativity and love of colours NiRa Rubens was born. The context is that of Riviera del Brenta, a location of great cultural and artistic repute due to its patrician villas, planned and painted between 1400 and 1700 by renowned artists such as Palladio, Tiziano, Tintoretto, Tiepolo.

This is a new brand, a young company where everithing radiates art and research, beginning with the name itself: NiRa, a combination of the founders' names, and Rubens, homage to the famed Flemish painter, master of colour.
Indeed, all of NiRa Rubens' creations distinghush themselves for their handmade drawings painted on every shoe by Venice Art Academy's trained artisans-artists. All of NiRa Rubens' collections are inspired by the universal symbols of the heart and the star, continuously reinvented and reassembled, and applied to the shoes through the use of new and original painting techniques, experimenting with different kinds of chromatic options.

NiRa Rubens' hallmark is undoubtedly the red heart, where the power of fire merges into love's emotion. The heart and the star are then painted on some iconic sneakers' models, milestones for past and future generations.

The casual and glam identity of NiRa Rubens finds its natural space in the windows
of a selected network of premium clothing and accessories boutiques.
Its fashion style stands out for the mix and match of materials refined, in details and ""hand made in Italy"" decorations that give products uniqueness and originality protected by the International Model Design storage at EUIPO.

No.1 Como,"['Kidswear', 'Menswear', 'Womenswear']","BRAND: No.1 Como DESCRIPTION: The outdoor brand No.1 Como was founded in 2015 by Michael Boveleth and Martin Schmelzer. Both have many years of experience in the fashion industry and have already been successful together with the BLONDE NO.8 label. The trademark of No.1 Como was initially the many light down styles in bright colors. Even today, these looks in a refined form are still an integral part of every collection. In the meantime, No.1 Como is best known for the wide variety of fashion styles that inspire customers from all generations: whether long coats , nylon waistcoats , oversized or short boxy styles - all wishes are fulfilled. The range of colors is as diverse as the customers themselves. The combination of fashion and function is particularly convincing: almost all jackets are coated with Teflon and are therefore water-repellent. Functional elements such as reflectors are stylishly integrated into the product and thus become eye-catchers. 

While fashion aspects are constantly evolving, the brand is moving more and more towards sustainability. An important step was to gradually replace the classic down filling with PET thermore , and recycled materials are also increasingly being used for the outer fabrics. Most products are also BLUESIGN® certified, which means that sustainable and environmentally friendly manufacturing processes are implemented.

The further development of existing styles and the implementation of fashion trends in a functional product are what drives the company and makes the world a little more colourful.

After exploring the country together, they decided to combine the last of their travelling money to invest in a selection of fair trade handicrafts from Nepal. They brought these purchases back to the UK and sold them at the first ever Nomads market stall in Camden, London. The success of these market stalls soon saw us begin to manufacture our own products, and we began to build lifelong relationships with artisan producers and fair trade factories in India. Today we focus our attentions on designing and creating contemporary clothing that is 100% ethically produced and celebrates traditional artisan skills - whilst using the best quality natural fibres and environmentally friendly processes.

Duncan and Vicky still visit India every year, and the Pushkar Camel Fair will always hold a special place in their hearts…

We continue to create ethical fair trade clothing that celebrates natural fibres and traditional artisan techniques and Nomads Clothing can be found in 350 shops all over the world. Let’s see what the next 30 years brings…

No Name,['Footwear'],"BRAND: No Name DESCRIPTION: NO NAME HISTORY

At the dawn of the nineties, almost ten years before Naomi Klein's hit No Logo, Rautureau fights against the tyranny of brands. But in singular, clever and off-the-walls ways. On the basis of a simple look, No Name makes the Sneaker Planet lose its mind. Here, the brand is no priority, only the product matters. The sneaker No Name and its platform, often copied but never reached, makes the women 5 centimeters taller and even more stylish. Quickly, the Plato Sneaker becomes a rallying symbol for all those claiming the democracy of cool.

Twenty years later, No Name hasn’t aged at all. Even better, the sneaker always has a head start on its rivals, unable to compete with this condensed simplicity. Less is more and even more in No Name.

It’s not because you don’t have a name that no one remembers you. It’s exactly the opposite … when you’re named No Name. PLATO SNEAKER NO NAME - The 90's are packed in its platform.

Noni,"['Womenswear', 'Footwear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Noni DESCRIPTION: noni stands not only for simply beautiful, but also fairly produced bridal fashion: in the production of our wedding dresses, we strive to implement resource-saving and sustainable concepts for our brides to protect the environment. Even if the procurement of organic quality materials in the bridal fashion sector is unfortunately still not easy, it is still possible to tailor wedding dresses in an ecologically responsible way that you can buy with a clear conscience. Thus, some of our current wedding dress collections are primarily made from sustainable or recycled textiles.

The times when the wedding dress was worn only once and then disappears forever in the garment bag are over: our wedding dresses, tops, bodies, skirts and pants are designed so that you can wear them long after the wedding in combination with a favorite part of your everyday wardrobe.

Fashion Revolution Week - Since 2020, noni has participated in the international initiative that aims to revolutionize the fashion industry. The annual themed week around April 24, the day that marks the collapse of the Rana Plaza building in Bangladesh in 2013, is all about developing greater awareness of the impact of global textile production on our fragile ecosystem. Through this valuable alliance, you can engage intensively with the topics of slow fashion and sustainability and learn about the latest developments. NONI BRIDAL FASHION IS ""MADE IN EUROPE"".
A noni wedding dress is designed and tailored with great care and love for the craft. Our collections are designed on site in Cologne and produced by professionally trained tailors and apprentices in our own workshop in Cologne and in selected factories in Europe. noni bridal fashion is therefore made in Europe and of course under safe and hygienic working conditions with fair wages. 

WE AVOID OVERPRODUCTION
For the sake of the environment, we avoid overproduction of dresses and accessories like our stoles and loops. Our stock is deliberately kept low, as many outfits are only sewn to order and we  only order manageable quantities from our external manufacturers too. 

Of course, in the online store you always have the option to order several parts to choose from and send back to us what does not meet your expectations. Returned wedding dresses with small blemishes are not destroyed and disposed of as with large fashion chains, but are carefully checked by our quality assurance, defects are removed and can hope for a new home at an outlet appointment or in the online sale to make another bride happy.

NONI PRELOVED - SECOND HAND WEDDING DRESSES
We are aware that not every bride has a generous budget for her wedding dress. At the same time, there are many brides who have no use for their wedding dress after their own wedding. Before a dress that has only been worn once gets dusty in the closet, we offer a new service with noni preloved: we sell your worn noni wedding dress second hand in our noni boutique in Cologne. This way a new noni bride can put together her dream outfit for the big day at a very reasonable price. Buying (and selling) a second hand wedding dress is 100% sustainable and a contemporary statement.

NORTVI is a premium Dutch travel brand that makes perfectly designed suitcases from sustainable materials.

NORTVI products are designed entirely by hand and sustainability is a key part of NORTVI’s brand identity. The inside of all cases is made from 100% recycled PET bottles and the outside is made from recycled polycarbonate. All cases are made of the strongest materials so that they last a lifetime.

Fashion meets travel; NORTVI only creates products of the highest quality with a fashionable design. It’s the first Dutch brand that sees suitcases as a stylish extension of your outfit.

NORTVI was founded by three Dutch entrepreneurs, all of whom have lived abroad for a long time and have a lot of travel experience. They missed a high-quality suitcase that meets the wishes of the stylish & conscious consumer and therefore decided to establish NORTVI. Collection

The NORTVI collection consists of a unique collection of cabin luggage suitcases, an elegant matching bag line and other beautiful travel accessories. NORTVI stands for durability, design and high quality. Every NORTVI suitcase comes with a 5-year warranty.

NORTVI ensures that a suitcase finally becomes truly functional.

Noserider Surf Club,['Sportswear'],"BRAND: Noserider Surf Club DESCRIPTION: ABOUT:
Noserider Surf Club is more than surfwear—it's a lifestyle. What started as a creative outlet, quickly formed into a community and eventually a brand. Offering women timeless, comfy, and stylish surf gear, it fosters a sense of belonging both on and off the waves.

Founder Emma Bukowski's vision comes to life with Noserider Surf Club, a surfwear brand that goes beyond style—it's a community of women embracing freedom and expression while confidently riding the waves. In the midst of Bali's challenges, Emma created Noserider to fill the gap in surf gear availability. More than swimwear, Noserider is a community where everyone feels at home, both on and off the waves. ""Surfing might be solo, but the shared passion brings us together,"" says Emma.

Join Noserider Surf Club for a wave-riding experience focused on empowerment, friendship, and living the dream.

NOUMENON,"['Womenswear', 'Footwear', 'Accessories', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: NOUMENON DESCRIPTION: Noumenon has been founded in 2016 by AMFI alumna Dena Simaite (27), with the idea to combine ethics with aesthetics.

Inspired by the Noumenal world of the philosopher Kant, Dena’s vision is to create cruelty-free fashion which is ethically produced yet sophisticated. The timeless garments are composed for the conscious woman who wants to feel beautiful and comfortable, from the inside and out. For Dena, design and quality are key. She believes that fashion is even more beautiful when created ethically and cruelty-free. It is therefore not a surprise that she thinks highly of pure fabrics. The collection exists of linen, organic cotton, cupro and Tencel (recycled woodpulp), but Simaite also works with innovative recycled fabrics and gives surplus fabrics a new life.

Every fabric and garment finds its origin in Europe, to reduce as much CO2 as possible. Furthermore the ink used for the prints are environmentally friendly. Also, the brandlabels are made from recycled cotton and the tags are made of recycled paper. Last but not least, every order placed in Amsterdam will be delivered in a recycled package by the 100% electric company car BIRO.

With Noumenon Dena hopes to the change the world in a positive way. Her motto is: ‘Change the world, and look amazing while you do it.’

“Nove wants to give mothers-to-be modern essentials that effortlessly stand the test of time.” - Janina Waschkowski, Founder

Janina Waschkowski, a mother of two, founded Nove in 2019. During both of her pregnancies, Janina couldn’t find what she was looking for - high quality and elegant maternity wear that was made sustainably. Only simple and inferior materials are used for most of the maternity wear on the market, due to the fact that the clothes have one purpose - to be worn only when pregnant. Janina didn’t want to adapt her style and values just because she was expecting a child. In that moment, Nove was born.",https://www.nove.store,"{'neg': 0.025, 'neu': 0.9, 'pos': 0.075, 'compound': 0.8442}",0.8442,Positive,en

Over time, Novesta has become the latest European brand, manufactured exclusively in Europe. Unique sneakers and their imaginative and timeless design have become popular all over the world.

Ecological footwear
When we talk about quality design, we are not just talking about a fashionable attitude. Our mission is to produce footwear in accordance with the highest environmental standards. That is why we use materials such as natural rubber, 100% cotton and flax. These materials allow us to produce high quality, harmless and ecological footwear.

At Novesta, we only use certified materials. During production, the rubber sole is pressed by means of a high-pressure machine and pressed onto the ""body"" of the shoe. The shoes are then finished with precise handwork. This highly ecological process leaves a mark, a rubber line around the shoe - the Novesta trademark!

At Novesta, we are extremely proud of the tradition, legacy and quality of our handmade shoes. We will be happy if you honor us with your visit or purchase in our eshop, where there are shoes from the latest collection.

Everyday and from Waalwijk, the Netherlands’ home of the shoe, we strive to improve what we put on our feet and make footwear that is as comfortable as can be. In other words, as light as can be.

In essence, our lightness is our luxury standard.

Nudie Jeans,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Kidswear', 'Denim', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Nudie Jeans DESCRIPTION: Philosophy
Nudie Jeans is based on an idea. This idea is in turn composed of several concepts, beliefs, and a good portion of old fashioned fighting spirit. The pursuit of doing the opposite was one of the main reasons the brand got started, although not an end in itself. It was rather the passion for dry denim that pointed the brand in that direction. The raw, untreated fabric had at the time been falling into oblivion, and it wasn't sought after by the public.

Wholesale enquiries can be directed to salessupport@nudiejeans.com Nudie Jeans’ environmental philosophy was present even before the first collection was designed. Back then, organic cotton had been around for a while, but more or less as a fly-by. The demand for these fabrics was on the decrease. The supply followed. Yet another opportunity to do the opposite. Driven by conviction and determination, the process for an all-organic denim brand took off. The share of sustainable materials increased over the years, and since 2012 all Nudie Jeans denim is made with 100% organic cotton.

In contrast to organic cotton, conventional cotton accounts for 25% of the global use of artificial pesticides but covers only 3% of the farmland. Obtaining one kilo of conventional cotton takes the same amount of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and biocides. This quantity can’t be considered as ”lagom”. It’s not ”just the right amount”. 

The most environmentally friendly would be if we all went naked, cultivated our own food, and asked our gut for advice instead of a Silicon Valley-based oracle. Our environmental policy doesn’t reach that far. We still make jeans. It’s our passion. But we made the choice to manufacture our product in a fair and ethical way. An opportunity every company is given, but too few take. 

Our jeans are not designed to be used a few times and then thrown away. We cherish the well-worn and mended. Jeans that become a part of ourselves when worn a long time – a second skin. A pair of dry denim jeans is the materialized version of our values: No extra treatment or washes. Made with 100% organic cotton. 

Add the concept of wear and break-in (six months of daily use without laundering) and our promise of free repairs. Combine it with used denim going back into the loop as second-hand jeans or raw material for new products. All this equals a smarter way to consume, and also an environmentally sustainable product. 

We work only with suppliers that share our values. Together with Fair Wear Foundation we ensure safe and ethical working conditions across the whole line of production. It’s our way to get as close to ”just the right amount” as possible. A little more ”lagom”. 

A way to get the balance right.

They grew up studying/working in completely different professions within Business, Finance, Design/Advertising, and that knowledge is a key success to this company. The year was 2015 and Pontus Krusing, the CEO of the company was studying in Hong Kong, and he didn’t have a case on his phone because of the lack of good phone cases in Europe. One day he found a super thin case in a small shop on the streets of Hong Kong and he immediately bought it. It felt like there wasn’t a case on the phone and that was the moment when the idea of Nudient was born. When he got back to Sweden he talked to his friends Max and Pontus about this thin case. Nudient was founded in a coffee shop on Sveavägen, Stockholm 2016.

Nudnik engineers our 'Future-Proof Kidswear' exclusively from pre-consumer textile waste that would otherwise pollute the planet. On the surface, there’s not a lot of crossover between fashion and waste management, but in reality, fast fashion is now the second largest polluter on the planet with way too many tentacles: the chemicals in the dyes, the fact that it takes 2700 litres of water to manufacture one t-shirt, the synthetic blended fabrics shedding microplastics throughout our water systems, and the fact the fashion industry has the highest amount of both pre-consumer and post-consumer waste, with almost everything eventually ending up in landfills or being burned. We just simply weren’t ok with this and set out to shake things up! And we did. We’ve disrupted how we make, package and consume clothing.

OBEY,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Bodywear', 'Eyewear', 'Bags', 'Accessories']","BRAND: OBEY DESCRIPTION: The OBEY sticker campaign can be explained as an experiment in Phenomenology. Heidegger describes Phenomenology as “the process of letting things manifest themselves.” Phenomenology attempts to enable people to see clearly something that is right before their eyes but obscured; things that are so taken for granted that they are muted by abstract observation. Because people are not used to seeing advertisements or propaganda for which the product or motive is not obvious, frequent and novel encounters with the sticker provoke thought and possible frustration, nevertheless revitalizing the viewer’s perception and attention to detail. The sticker has no meaning but exists only to cause people to react, to contemplate and search for meaning in the sticker. Because OBEY has no actual meaning, the various reactions and interpretations of those who view it reflect their personality and the nature of their sensibilities. Many people who are familiar with the sticker find the image itself amusing, recognizing it as nonsensical, and are able to derive straightforward visual pleasure without burdening themselves with an explanation. The PARANOID OR CONSERVATIVE VIEWER however may be confused by the sticker’s persistent presence and condemn it as an underground cult with subversive intentions. Many stickers have been peeled down by people who were annoyed by them, considering them an eye sore and an act of petty vandalism, which is ironic considering the number of commercial graphic images everyone in American society is assaulted with daily.

Ocean Rodeo,,"BRAND: Ocean Rodeo DESCRIPTION: Here on Vancouver Island, Canada, we’re far from a tropical paradise. Our island creates the perfect testing grounds to develop equipment for extreme marine conditions. Strong winds meeting cold waters on a remote, rocky, log strewn coastline is what we call home.

It’s our playground, we love it this way, and it’s these often unwelcoming conditions that drive Ocean Rodeo’s innovation. Whether you’re a recreational enthusiast or a professional mariner, you can rest assured that when the conditions slide unexpectedly into the extreme, we will have you covered… Ocean Rodeo’s founder, Richard Myerscough, and his lifelong friend Ross Harrington grew up first and foremost as avid adventurists. The two were active in the formative years of windsurfing, cold water surfing, kiteboarding and SUP. Never tiring or stopping to be active in the sport, and to this day proud to be riders, not investors.

Self taught and making early models of all their equipment in the 70’s and 80’s, Richard and Ross learned the hard way that good enough was never good enough, and continue to bring their creative and innovative outlook to every new project Ocean Rodeo sets into motion.",http://www.dutchmint.eu,"{'neg': 0.006, 'neu': 0.753, 'pos': 0.24, 'compound': 0.9939}",0.9939,Positive,en

Hannah’s expertise and skills derive from fashion and business studies followed by extensive industry practice of developing textiles and embroidery for luxury design houses. Hannah introduced a unique design - a hybrid of glamorous eveningwear and functional swimwear.

Oceanus disrupted the industry and is experiencing rapid growth in Europe as well as the US. The brand has now launched in Harrods and Flannels and is continuously featured in magazines like Vogue and Tatler.

We see ourselves as enthusiasts, lovers, but mostly we take great pleasure in creating fashion that we believe in. At OHDH, we are constantly looking for new trends, designs, colors and fabrics which we are using as inspiration for our products. We want to respond to the current hypes with an “old habits” twist. We shall never work according to the existing rules, meaning we shall not present a collection each season. We live in the moment, we design in the moment and we will launch our products at the right moment.

At this moment, we want to focus on headwear. Starting with multiple colored hats and caps. In addition, we designed a numerous amount of handmade straps for our Old Habits hats. The idea behind our straps is that we want to give you the opportunity to change the look of your hat at any time. To us, a hat isn’t a piece you only wear for one season. We want it to become part of your expression and therefore, you need to be able to adjust the look at any time. Although we started with headwear, we are not afraid to try out other items.

We hope you will enjoy our products!

This was not going to be your ordinary bag, and a responsible approach was key.
Made from a unique kind of eco-leather, an O My Bag is a piece that you can flaunt without guilt. This is due to a cleaner and safer tanning process, a reduced carbon footprint, and leather that is made with respect for the environment.

Supporting and encouraging others in their efforts to leave the world as beautiful, diverse and healthy as we found it. Our mission is born out of our heritage of the  California surf.

Jack’s initial vision of producing functional and innovative board riding products expanded to include snow wear and continues to lie at the core of everything the company does. Even today, our collection of casual, swim, snow and beach wear is inspired by our love for our ocean and winter playgrounds. Our collections have a unique fit, technical features and hybrid fabrics that allow you to easily move from the ocean and the mountains to the city and anywhere in between.

We live by Jack O’Neill’s words: The Ocean is alive and we’ve got to take care of it, Our Ocean Mission is O’Neill’s commitment to protect the oceans for generations to come. The O’Neill Blue collection is a movement towards environmental responsibility, and a commitment to use sustainable materials.

Original Penguin,"['Menswear', 'Kidswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Original Penguin DESCRIPTION: n 1955, a sportswear icon was born from the most unusual of places. Fuelled by whiskey and a delayed flight, Abbot Pederson purchased an unlikely drinking buddy for his flight home in the form of a stuffed penguin he named Pete. At some point during the flight, and after another cocktail or three, he accidentally knocked the head off Pete the Penguin. A stewardess on-board the flight wrapped a necktie around the Penguins neck and quipped ‘He would look good on a shirt’ which led Pederson to embroider this character on his new shirts. An Icon was born.

Since then Pete the Penguin has left his mark on a league of legends from Frank to Bing and Clint to Arnie. Original Penguin had been adorned and adored by the masters of culture and sport to define itself as an American classic that knows how to have fun. Still revered by the originals of today, this iconic brand now fully encompasses the lifestyle of what it means to be an original, and how to enjoy yourself while doing it.

Oscar Deen,['Eyewear'],"BRAND: Oscar Deen DESCRIPTION: “Mate, I think we should do something…I don’t know what yet” Hailing from Hackney and Camden respectively, we were two Londoners living in Manchester with a desire to make something. What? We didn’t know yet and that was exciting.

A little chat in the haze of a day party planted the seed, a chance meeting with an eyewear collector connected the dots. OD started when we realised that we never went anywhere without our sunglasses. And it was the going anywhere, that really sealed the deal.

Obsessed with the summer, just like the city we hail from. We now travel the markets, alleys and antique shops of Europe, finding the vintage gems that inspire our collection, and meeting the people who inspire our ethic. Every pair of OD frames start with scouring the streets of Europe to find the classic frames that form the basis of all our designs. We’ve found treasure in warehouse store cupboards, dingy front rooms and side street markets. But this ain’t a copycat thing. We spend weeks, sometimes months re-designing, modernising and putting our own touch on the frames we find. Turning a dusty old gem, into our idea of a modern classic.

Then we make our final frames from hand finished Mazzucchelli acetate. They’re Italian, if the name didn’t give it away, and they’ve been top of their game since 1849. Our tinted lenses are made from lightweight CR-39 plastic and coated for proper UV protection.

Our clothes are manufactured in highly qualified family factories, in France and Portugal, with particular care taken in the manufacture. Beyond the fashion image associated with it, each garment reflects a desire to go to the essentials and finds its signature in attention to detail and cuts, the quality of materials and manufacturing. Outland is above all a long history of friendship. After more than 15 years in the fashion industry, we decided to launch our brand in 2018, a deliberately scalable brand, imagined as a territory with indefinite contours (an ""outerland""), free to follow trends or not, and which reflects our vision of fashion and the values that drive us: explore new playgrounds, do less but do well, always with sincerity, without ever forgetting who we are.

OUTRGS,['Menswear'],"BRAND: OUTRGS DESCRIPTION: The new, exclusive Dutch men's label OUTRGS, created by entrepreneurs Stefan van Ruijven and Ramon Delgado was launched at the end of October 2020. They came up with the idea for OUTRGS when they visited a festival together. They once noticed how little diversity there is in the menswear market in comparison to women's clothing. The conclusion that the pair came to was that menswear is dominated by 'mainstream' fashion, they concluded. They decided to shake things up by setting up an exclusive men's fashion label themselves. With OUTRGS, Stefan and Ramon want to make men's clothing more diverse, with a sustainable mindset, self-devised designs and specially selected quality fabrics. Due to small editions and different designs, the clothes of OUTRGS are, and remain unique. The brand wants to appeal to men who want to emphasize their personality with their clothing. In addition, the fabrics and designs of OUTRGS are distinguished by the use of pronounced colours and in beautiful combinations. OUTRGS creates 'must-haves' that the customer wants to pull out of the closet every day. For men who are fashion conscious, but hold their own timeless fashion style; items that never go out of fashion.

Ozeano Vision,['Eyewear'],"BRAND: Ozeano Vision DESCRIPTION: Ozeano is more than just eyewear, it's a global family bound by a love for experiencing the natural world and a deep passion for protecting it. We started out as two travellers left horrified by the sight of a heavily littered beach in Sihanoukville, Cambodia, and our desire to make a difference led to the forming of an environmentally-friendly eyewear brand headquartered on the east coast of Sydney, Australia. Our core objective is to encourage people to see the natural world, whilst ensuring we help to protect its future. We seek to achieve that with our unwavering commitment to provide the highest natural quality eyewear, with the lowest environmental impact.

Over 80% of the Western population wear sunglasses, yet traditional plastic frames take upwards of 450 years to decompose. That's hundreds of millions of virgin plastic sunglasses that are discarded in to our ecosystem and contributing to the pollution problem our planet is facing. We're here to offer an alternative. All Ozeano sunglasses are inspired by (and named after) the beauty of the natural world and are designed and ethically handmade in Australia using a 100% biodegradable plant-based bio-acetate. All accessories are either 100% GOTS-certified organic cotton or FSC-certified Portuguese cork, and all our products are PETA-approved vegan. Our shipping is carbon-neutral, and courier packaging is 100% biodegradable. With every sale, we fund the removal of 12kg of marine litter from our oceans and waterways (equivalent to over 900 plastic bottles), as well as funding an eye care operation to restore vision for a person in need. We're a proud gold-standard member of the '1% for the planet' organisation, and our circular economy offering means you can return sunglasses at any time to receive 25% off your next purchase, ensuring our products never go to waste. 

That's where we are today. We don't claim to be perfect, and are constantly evolving in pursuit of finding better ways in everything that we do.

Ozeano's ability to make a difference is only made possible by your support, and for that, no words could possibly portray our gratitude to you.  

Thank you for visiting, and we look forward to welcoming you to the family! 

Ozeano ~ Experience nature, protect its future.

Palladium,['Footwear'],"BRAND: Palladium DESCRIPTION: Palladium was founded in 1920 to make tires for the fledgling aviation industry. Tires were made by layering canvas bands underneath vulcanized rubber. Palladium's expertise was so advanced that soon the majority of Europe's aircraft were using Palladium tires. After World War II, with aircraft manufacturing screeching to a halt, the demand for tires decreased dramatically. Palladium decided to open a plant in Pont De Cheruy, France, to start producing footwear that was as hard wearing as their tires. In 1947 the legendary Pampa boot was born, and the functionality, comfort and durability were so outstanding that the French Foreign Legion adopted it for their use. The Foreign Legion put the boot to the test in the harsh desert conditions of North Africa, and throughout the rugged terrain of the Atlas Mountains.

Today, the original design, classic lines and time tested utility are as relevant as they have ever been. Combining over 60 years of authenticity with modern manufacturing, premium materials and cutting edge styling, Palladium boots are ready to help you explore your street, your city, or the world

Papaya & Bamboo,['Womenswear'],"BRAND: Papaya & Bamboo DESCRIPTION: Founding Papaya & Bamboo was a dream I never dared to dream! Since I was a grown-up I was in love with clean & timeless clothing. Pieces that look great but never overdressed. They needed to be special, by a detail, an accessory or a color. At that time I dreamt the childish dream of having a clothes shop, being able to sell the nicest clothes I could find. A few years of education and experience later I dreamt of having my own fashion magazine. Not like the one I was working on in my job - I had a fancy one in mind that I could shape the way I wanted it to be. Moving a few years later from Europe to Asia changed my life even more. Overnight I was tasked with different challenges that come with a totally new environment, culture, language and temperature. At first I felt like I didn't know who I was anymore. But soon I enjoyed it! I met so many new people with different backgrounds, life stories and unusual careers. And I realized: there are no more boxes that I have to fit into! No more right or wrong! The only think that counts is being happy - just the way I am!

Our philosophy is focused on valorizing contrasts, contrasts within our bags, and within people. This is the basis for creating our sustainable luxury.

Our leather bags, hand-woven in Italy thanks to an ancient 18th century Treadle Loom, are made with a living material, crafted using the most modern technologies.

Our bags are born in a small workshop between Venice and the Dolomites, but then they cross the world beyond the boundaries, and beyond time and space.

Like a beat that finds its purpose in silence. 09 our unit of measurement
«We have chosen a number that has become our matrix, because “even the highest spiritual audacity rests on exact sciences.» [Musil]

09 is the width of the leather strip, the protagonist of our weave. And it has become our magic number. Our handmade bags in Italy are proof of this.

60 are the minutes it takes to knit 60 cm of woven leather

15 are the nodes in 09x09 cm of our woven leather fabric

1789 is the year in which the treadle loom we use was invented.

Pascucci,['Footwear'],"BRAND: Pascucci DESCRIPTION: Pascucci has been manufacturing ladies shoes since 1945.

Its founder, Mr. Spartaco Pascucci, he had been a shoes worker since his youth, working in the main shoe factory in his hometown, Fucecchio. Having already enough knowledge and skill to make every kind of shoe from sandals to boots, he decided to make shoes himself. With the help of his wife, Mrs. Lori Cambi, expert stitcher, he opened a little shoe workshop near home in the late Forties. Due to growing shoe production, the shoe workshop moved to a bigger place in the late Sixties. In the beginning of the Seventies, the production of “scarponi” and boots, changed in ladies' moccassins. When the current Chairman, Mr. Furio Fierli, who married Mr. Pascucci's only daughter Maura, joined the firm, he was an expert shoemaker, too.

Pascucci's name became very well known in Italy during the Seventies as a moccasin maker, and this fame from the beginning of the Eighties spreaded outside the Italian borders.

Now the team of Maestro Shoes Srl (that carrying on the family link, now includes Walter and Tiziana Fierli) is justly proud of its reputation for high quality footwear.

Passenger,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Passenger DESCRIPTION: We count ourselves lucky to call home The New Forest. Situated a few minutes from the coast and the forest, both of these elements are a constant source of inspiration. Our Ethos is very simple. We aim to share what we as a team are passionate about and unite like-minded people through a sense of community.

There are so many people that endure the rat race everyday, but like us, are constantly seeking adventure and the freedom that can bring. We want to inspire people to find their own paths, push their boundaries and embrace their own journey whatever that might be. Escapism, a constant desire to get off grid, wander, travel to connect with people and nature. These elements have been at the heart of Passenger from the beginning. Many of us look to escape, whether it’s the 9 to 5, cold winter’s or escaping our daily routines even if its just for a short while or a weekend adventure.

We pay attention to the smallest details and design them to transport us from the daily grinds but still usable for everyday life. Stories of escapism are woven into the fabric of our products and each design tells a different one, the smell of a campfire on a beanie or the sweat-stain on a favourite t-shirt. We design all our products with this in mind, hoping that another story will be made with each one. We believe that what you wear reflects who you are and that’s important to us.

We’re inspired by stories of like-minded people and we love sharing them. That feeling found every time we tell or read an ‘oh man you should have been there’ story. Our mission is to help people escape through their own journey even it’s only for a short while. Everything we do is inspired by the desire to live a life of memorable adventures – big or small, short or long. It has never been about destinations for us but rather the journeys that lead us there and the memories we make along the way.",https://www.passenger-clothing.com,"{'neg': 0.004, 'neu': 0.796, 'pos': 0.2, 'compound': 0.9972}",0.9972,Positive,en

Both were instrumental in the Dutch hip-hop and nightlife community in the 90’s and early 2000’s - Edson as a DJ and Gee as an MC and event host. The music minded pair also had a shared obsession with hunting internationally for sneakers and records. They soon found themselves funneling a steady supply of gear from their travels, back home to their community in Amsterdam, which grew naturally into a business partnership. Before they knew it, the demand started growing, and a cult favorite brand was born. Today, Patta is one of few internationally revered, black-owned streetwear brands and consists of a clothing line, Patta Soundsystem, Patta Running Team and, most recently, the Patta Foundation focusing on youth cultural education. The brand is named after a slang term for “shoe” - a nod to the founders’ Surinamese heritage. A creative family to the core, Patta encourages inspiring collaborations, cultural crossover, and unconventional forms.

Peak Performance,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Kidswear', 'Bags', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Peak Performance DESCRIPTION: ONCE UPON A TIME...
… back in 1986, two very passionate skiers, one of them a world-class mogul skier with several World Cup wins, were sitting next to each other in a chairlift heading up a mountain. About to test and write about a new skiwear line, they started to talk about why no one was making skiwear that they wanted to wear. Garments that combined excellent functionality with simple, attractive design. Also, they wondered if there was any way that they could stay longer and more often in the ski resort they both loved - the little mountain village Åre, in northern Sweden. It turned out that the answer to both questions was Peak Performance. Initially, their ambitions didn’t extend much beyond making some clothes for themselves and their friends, in sufficient quantities to make a living from it. The business was shaped by what was important to them. Finding the right design and technical solution was paramount.
 
And the strategy worked. In the late 1980’s, people were tired of extravagance and superficiality. Everybody was looking for the real thing that comes with genuine quality. Ski jackets with leather details and flannel shirts were suddenly the answer, rather than neon and looking like a fully decorated Christmas tree. Orders generated by the first mail order catalog overwhelmed the little post office in town. So much so that they had to take on more staff just to keep up.  
 
During the early years, most things took longer to do than they should have. After all, Peak Performance was a company founded by skiers – people who more than anything else wanted to ski come winter. Anyone who managed to find our little office in Åre was often confronted with a sign on the front door that read: Gone skiing.

Years later he met Manuel Tárraga, a skilled shoemaker who was mad about shoes and also had the same dream. Both men worked successfully in the shoe industry for decades. With the experience acquired over the years Mr. López offered Mr. Tárraga a partnership. In 1982 both men came to the decision to set up their own company in Almansa under the Pertini brand name. The brand soon distinguished itself for its innovative designs and high-quality footwear.

Petra Design,['Sportswear'],"BRAND: Petra Design DESCRIPTION: This is everybody’s world.

We are committed to making things the right way not the easy way.
From yarn sourcing to final delivery, we choose ethical and sustainable partners. 

We make everything in Italy from a selection of environmentally friendly materials. Recycled polyester
Widely available and made from reclaimed PET bottles,  it does not require new petroleum to be extracted and  thus reduces CO₂ emissions by 75% with respect to virgin polyester.          

It is very lightweight, water repellent and quick-dry, colour fast and pilling resistant. 

Recycled nylon
Nylon, a type of polyamide, can now also be recycled for textiles, although only a handful of extremely specialised manufacturers in the world can achieve this efficiently and economically enough (e.g. ECONYL®, Italian yarn manufacturer, world leader in nylon recycling). 

Nylon is commonly recycled from fishing nets.
It is soft, stretchy and durable.    

Natural fibres
Such as our certified organic cotton, or our regenerated biodegradable fibres such as viscose and lyocell which  are derived from wood pulp of bamboo, beech or eucalyptus. 

Cotton is well known for comfort. 
Viscose feels lustrous, breathable and softer than cotton.
Lyocell is soft and lustrous and know for its biodegradability in aqueous solutions.

Pierre-Louis Mascia,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Pierre-Louis Mascia DESCRIPTION: Pierre-Louis Mascia is known to be unrivaled in the art of mixing, superimposing and combining prints: he does so with amazing freedom and a pronounced graphic sense, which he probably developed on his first jobs as fashion illustrator for magazines such as Vogue USA and Elle.

Before launching his first line in 2007, in partnership with the Uliassi brothers, he was also the artistic director of the Première Classe show, and in charge of lines of accessories for Clergerie, Stéphane Kélian, and Arche.

His connection with Achille Pinto, an Italian firm developing prints, was decisive and gave birth to a collection of scarves, soon to be followed by a prêt à porter line under his own name. Since then Pierre-Louis Mascia has reconciled technology and craftsmanship, knowledge and know-how, in the design of original, emotionally-charged garments.
Pierre-Louis Mascia uses collage to create intricate patterns of surprising visual clarity which he prints allover wearable items. He seamlessly merges the achingly sharp and the softly organic in the same cadre, relying on sudden about-turns, unexpected parallels and optical duplicity.

Today Achille Pinto S.p.A. has a production site extending over 30.000m2, employing a workforce of 250 staff and enjoying a sales turnover in constant growth. Run by the brothers Paolo and Matteo Uliassi, the company is a supplier, distributor and licensee of leading names in the textiles and clothing industry. Along with representing an important aspect of the company's heritage, the upkeep and recovery of historical archives provide customers with an inexhaustible source of ideas, designs, jacquards, embroideries, effects and colors.

 
“ I feel more like a dessinateur than a fashion designer. The mix of different patterns, a constant attention to the color palette and the use of certain materials define the identity of my collections” he says. “Each season I begin by mixing references, patterns and designs, then reduce it down progressively into a collection”. Cut-up is integral to his life and practice, from the prints he conceives to a lifestyle of constant commuting between France and Italy.

In order to support different humanitarian causes, which are even important due to the global challenges we all face today, we created an exclusive shoe collection inspired by the actions developed by the Portuguese Red Cross(Cruz Vermelha Portuguesa) over the past few years.

For many, Red Cross is a source of hope, which is the main reason why Pintta started this solidarity campaign: to continue giving hope and to give smiles on those who need it the most.

This collection has the elegant, contemporary and versatile essence that Pintta has accustomed its customers to, combined with details inspired by the Red Cross. This collection have timeless pieces that can even be seen as a work of art!

There is only one model of each pair worldwide, 7 models are for men, size 42, and 2 models are for women, size 38. The nine models are numbered, therefore, exclusive and made with unique details that personalize each piece.

Each pair sold will result in the contribution of 60% of its sales value to support the Portuguese Red Cross, contributing to some of their projects.

Help Pintta to help the Red Cross by purchasing this exclusive model, for yourself or to give away during the holiday season.

Together, we walk to make a difference!

Pip plays a central role in the brand, and is Anke's alter ego. Pip takes her fans on a journey and in search of inspiration for each new collection she creates. These stories are the leitmotif, or if you prefer, the soul of the brand. With the nickname from her childhood and her studio, the brand name was also quickly found. Pip's studio makes everyday products, especially things that she herself cannot find to her own taste. Her eye for detail, special finishes and layered designs give these collections a twist with the aim of adding a sparkle to everyday life. This design vision is expressed in Pip Studio's motto, 'Happy products for Happy people'.

Pip always follows what her heart tells her, and stays true to her intuition. She sets the bar high, the use of the most beautiful materials and the best 'make' is not annoyed. Her collections are never isolated and are always part of a larger whole. The special thing is that Pip's ethos is heart-warming, she touches a universal sensitive chord without being consciously involved.

PODYH,['Womenswear'],"BRAND: PODYH DESCRIPTION: PODYH is a Ukrainian womenswear brand created at the intersection of architecture and fashion. The brand's main idea is to reconsider the architecture; approaches and techniques of architects through clothing and accessories.

PODYH was founded in 2021. The designer of the brand - Daria Plaksyuk - graduated from architecture school. Positioning it at the crossroads of architecture and fashion, the architectural background collaborates greatly with the aesthetics and meaningfulness of the brand’s designs.
An architect always pays attention to the functionality, climate conditions, landscape, and environment of the future building. And make appropriate compositional and structural decisions. This is very similar to how clothes are designed. Season and local conditions dictate materials selection. Functionality and durability are achieved by technological and constructive decisions of various parts of the ware while being comfortable at the same time. Similar to buildings devoid of the unnecessary aesthetic ""noise"" of advertising posters, PODYH wares are not oversaturated with details, color, or decor. Each element is justified, corresponds to the idea, and creates a complete composition of volumes and lines. Inspired by outstanding architects of the past and present, who often involve artists and sculptors to enrich the object with details and give it a feeling of completeness, the designer pays excellent attention to handwork - even slight hand-made stitches make the thing more meaningful and valuable.

Pons Quintana,"['Bags', 'Footwear']","BRAND: Pons Quintana DESCRIPTION: The Company Pons Quintana was founded in 1953 in Alaior, Menorca. In the beginning it was centered on making children’s shoes but in 1956 it started producing slippers. At first, Pons Quintana only offered this model for women and it was not until later one, when they also started producing it for men. Wearing these slippers, and the appearance of the famous “Babucha” slipper, resulted in a new concept of home comfort and elegance. In 1968 the current factory was built, incorporating more modern machinery for the assembly and fabrication of its products.

From 1975, the first commercial contacts are made with Europe. In the early Eighties, the next generation come in to form part of the company, with its founder Mr. Santiago Pons Quintana remaining at its forefront. During this new project, both Italian and French designers are taken on and Pons Quintana begins to draft a definitive and international product line.

In 1990, with the incorporation of new technologies, the large Pons Quintana family continues to grow, with more than 100 employees in the factory at this point. All of this results in an important increase in its productivity and the consolidation of its brand.

During these years of progress and prosperity is when its founder, Santiago Pons Quintana decides to retire, handing over to the next generation of entrepreneur’s lead by his children, Magda and Santiago, who have since then been responsible for the company’s current image as well as making brave bets for their firm.

Pons Quintana defines itself, today, as a company open to the world.

We started researching and doing the first sketches in 2014 to guarantee you the best shoes. Our idea is to produce shoes with a great durability.

​They adapt to you by wearing them. MAKE THEM YOURS PHILOSOPHY

 In today's society, we tend to quickly replace ageing products with something more beautiful, more exciting. Many products are produced to be replaced after a maximum of one year.

​Many people have forgotten what it is like to identify with a product. The current trends do not allow you to age and grow with shoes or a pair of jeans. We see our shoes as skin, skin ages and one is not like the other.

Pour Moi,"['Bodywear', 'Sportswear', 'Swimwear', 'Womenswear']","BRAND: Pour Moi DESCRIPTION: The Pour Moi story so far...

Pour Moi started in a tiny office above a shop in Macclesfield, packed with materials, cardboard boxes, two staff members and one belief - that people shouldn’t have to overpay for good-fitting lingerie, no matter what their size. “I started Pour Moi using the money I’d made from selling my autograph collection. It was hard parting with them as some of those names I’d got personally,” laughs founder Michael Thomson. “But at least I can say that George Michael funded Pour Moi.”

Now nearly 15 years later, Pour Moi has outgrown its premises, added swimwear and nightwear to its collections, bought major lingerie brands and moved to Brighton to a sunny office by the sea. But while it’s bigger and better than ever, the brand’s core philosophy has always remained the same.

“We believe that the same bra should look just as good in a G cup as it does as a 34B. It should be the same bra for everyone,” states Michael.",https://www.pourmoi.co.uk,"{'neg': 0.016, 'neu': 0.91, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': 0.8735}",0.8735,Positive,en
POURS STUDIOS,['Womenswear'],"BRAND: POURS STUDIOS DESCRIPTION: POURS STUDIOS is a label for modern and elegant rainwear.

The classic garments with their modern tailoring are made of 100% waterproof material. The waterproof functionality is combined with a high-quality design in a unique way. The collection is produced exclusively in Germany. The garments are made in small quantities in the company‘s own atelier and local tailors. This avoids overproduction and long transport routes and ensures an excellent quality of workmanship.

POURS STUDIOS has made a conscious decision not to produce abroad (also in other EU countries), as the label wants to support the fair payment of seamstresses. We are happy to pay the seamstresses who support us in the production adequately and thus above the minimum wage.

The collection is made out of polyurethane-coated fabrics that guarantee very high water resistance. The fabric has a high stability due to a weight of 270g/m and is very comfortable to wear because of its elasticity. The seams are sealed by special seam tapes and gluing techniques, so that no water can leak through. For the future, POURS STUDIOS has set itself the goal of using more recycled materials.

The founder studied fashion design and was able to gain experience in design, as well as in pattern construction and production at McQ by Alexander McQueen, and at Vivienne Westwood „Gold Label“ (today: Andreas Kronthaler for Vivienne Westwood). She designed and developed all the POURS STUDIOS designs herself.

POWDERHORN,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: POWDERHORN DESCRIPTION: On his parents' farm, he began producing down vests with unique Western leather patches, knowing that they provided a greater level of comfort and durability.

Founded in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, POWDERHORN was largely inspired by the dramatic Teton mountain range. Widely known as one of the most rugged and authentic areas for skiers and mountaineers, the ski slopes of Jackson served as the perfect testing grounds for sturdy and reliable gear. The early line of products included down jackets, storm parkas, sleeping bags, packs, and even climbing hardware. The Jackson Hole Ski Patrol wore POWDERHORN’s signature down jackets with their recognizable Western yokes as their patrol uniforms for several years. They became patrol favorites and many were worn long after being officially retired from their uniform duty. POWDERHORN’s rich history and ties to the early pioneers of Teton skiing has remained an integral part of the brand since day one.

Our design is timeless yet modern, and pays homage to the days when pristine ski slopes, rugged mountains and an everyday lifestyle went hand in hand. By combining this design with the latest fabric and construction technologies, our outerwear obtains its unique, versatile character.

In addition, our collections include a wide range of bags, from formal clutch bags , through neat trunks, to capacious shopper bags . Handbag, shoes ... um, something else is missing here - of course, a belt! In our showrooms, you can also buy this essential item of clothing. A novelty that has come to our door are accessories, fashionable glasses and leather wallets, both for men and women.

We make every effort to ensure that our products are not only stylish and comfortable, but also durable, which is why we use high-quality materials: grain or patent leather, saffiano leather, suede, nubuck and strong fabrics. So that you can properly care for your Italian shoes, we also offer great care products: impregnations, sprays and shoe trees.

The latest PRIMAMODA collection is a response to global trends. It is dominated by classic styles, enriched with a hint of fantasy in the form of original details. The undisputed hit of the season is perforated leather, timeless shades of beige and black, as well as intense red and marine blue motifs. Colorful floral patterns and pastel colors are a real treat for women who want to bring a bit of optimism to everyday life.

PRIME SHOES,['Footwear'],"BRAND: PRIME SHOES DESCRIPTION: PRIME SHOES
has been manufacturing Goodyear welted shoes with an excellent price-performance ratio for more than 25 years.

Quality is not a question of technology, but a question of demands. To yourself, to the workmanship, to the design. PRIME SHOES models are welted using the traditional Goodyear process. Only a few manufacturers have mastered this method. It guarantees maximum resilience and long pleasure on all your journeys. We only use calfskin for our shoes, which allows the feet to breathe and makes the high  quality visible at first glance. Because a good shoe is your best companion - wherever you go. 

We insert a cork filling between the outer and inner sole, which adapts to your foot individually through warmth and body weight and protects it against the cold. The Goodyear seam is also embedded there, which - in contrast to conventional methods - cannot be felt. And neither when trying it on for the first time, nor after years of wearing it.

So it is no coincidence that welted shoes have always been the epitome of durability and maximum comfort. After all, you need the right footwear to change the world.

SRNDPTY,['Womenswear'],"BRAND: SRNDPTY DESCRIPTION: THIS IS SRNDPTY
Today you are going to remember as the day you gave yourself extra happiness and time as a gift. Confronting moments in fluorescent fitting rooms are over. Just like the disappointment when you take your latest fashion addition out of the washing machine for the first time. Or those times when you come into a party and you turn out not to be the only one who effortlessly manages to get eye-catching items from the department store shelves. Today you found SRNDPTY.
In your life you spend about 60,000 euros on clothes. That is a small apartment (okay, not in Amsterdam maybe), 30 times luxurious on holiday or 600 times eating out in a good restaurant. That's a lot. Very much. It is therefore not surprising that you sometimes feel guilty when tidying your wardrobe. About that impulse purchase you never carried. About the overpriced shirt that makes your face look pale. Or about that designer dress that is just a little too short to wear to work. And don't think of those tight jeans that keep reminding you of good intentions for which you really have too little time. 

Survival in the busy shopping street is no longer necessary. Goodbye parking stress. No more uncertainty when trying on or frustration with incorrect measurements. Never wondered why shopping can be so tough? 

And from now on, shopping dramas are a thing of the past for you. Now that you know SRNDPTY, you can fine-tune your personal style. Fit is never an issue again. It is always good and Dutch: not too short, not too tight and always comfortable. All items have subtle details that accentuate curves in the right way. At the same time, they camouflage the things that you are less happy with. Nobody sees your insecurities. On the contrary. You can see them thinking: well, she looks good! So prepare yourself for a gigantic boost of your self-confidence.

Protest,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Kidswear']","BRAND: Protest DESCRIPTION: Founded by a small group of snowboarders in Holland
That’s right: Holland. One of the flattest places in the universe. Home to exactly five hills and fourteen waves. That’s right: We counted the number of hills and waves and we said, “To hell with logic, to hell with obstacles – Let’s do what we love.” Since day one, we’ve been doing our part to make the world a better place for boarders – Both on the slopes and in the water. We do this by designing fashionable and functional sportswear at an affordable price. By reminding the world that boarding is fun. And by helping people overcome whatever stands between them and their boards. A fresh perspective for all boarders. The beginners who aren’t quite sure if they’ve got what it takes. The masters who may have forgotten the pure joy of the ride. The cynics who have had millions of ads pushed down their throats. The workaholics with too many responsibilities and too little time. We remind riders of the reason they set foot on a board in the first place – to have fun! And we inspire non-boarders with our belief that everyone can have a great time on the slopes or on the waves. Our clothes are built to support core riders. But they are also aimed at people who simply want to have fun on a board and look good doing it. Our goal is to make our clothes accessible to as many boarders as possible.

We create fashionable and functional sportswear for boarders on all levels
For the core boarder and newcomer alike, our fully functional boardwear reflects the latest trends in styles and colors. We believe in keeping a strong focus on details: materials, zippers, applications, embroideries, stitchings, fabrics, textures, finishes, and washes. This is what gives our range a rich and exclusive look. Our two main collections are Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter. Each collection features a Mens and Womens line, as well as a Boys and Girls line.

In Pushkar, she met Giri a guy who owned a small store of himalayan hemp products and he told her his story. He shared that he had been trying to empower women living in villages outside of Pushkar by employing them. She felt touched and bought 30 bags from him.

A glance at the bright blue sea and we became as certain as she is. The waves may seem wild on the surface, but underneath there’s calmness. We are stunned by the luminousness of the ocean. The way water adapts to various circumstances keeps on inspiring us. Water evaporates and freezes; ice and snow will cover mountains and reach for the sky. To us it’s clear: the darker the night, the brighter the stars. For that reason we started Qubz in precisely this period of space and time. Qubz brings light into the darkness. We keep pace with the changing world we live in. Moment by moment. Qubz consists of a vibrant team of specialists with transparent values - we care. Our menswear is protected against the elements. We adapt with the development of our technical designs and smart fabrics. To us the power of simplicity is of high value, but we certainly aren’t afraid to use bold and vivid colors. We believe a man needs a clear mind and his basic essentials: clever designs with eye-catching details.  Let us take care of that for you.
 
Positivity is a mindset; you choose the world you see. Life is good, even in uncertain times. Be good to all that’s around you. And above all, be good to yourself. It starts with you. Now is the moment to be your best self. Wear Qubz and stand out of in the crowd by being bright. Pass it on - and activate with optimism. Let the positive mentality be contagious.

He never missed a party and met some big names and many hot girls. During the day, he worked on his hot rod in his garage, with which he took part in races on various dragster slopes or salt lakes.

Over a beer in his garage in Bakersfield, California, he had an idea of ​​starting his own fashion brand!

King Kerosin was born. In this way he was able to realize his dream of sharing his lifestyle with others.

Under the slogan ""Made in Garage""the first T-shirts were printed in his garage at home. After a while he decided to go back to his home country Germany.

The European headquarters were founded in the ""racing city"" of Hockenheim, although the US headquarters, headed by Richard Burton, remained.

The small trendy brand gradually developed into a popular rockin 'streetwear brand, which is now worn by a wide variety of scenes.

At the trade fairs, there was or is no big sales event, but everything is under the motto ""fun"".

Qurc. Amsterdam,"['Footwear', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: Qurc. Amsterdam DESCRIPTION: QURC. is an Amsterdam-based fashion label, established in 2019. 

When it comes to high-end sneakers, we experienced a big gap between environmentally aware brands and the established order. In terms of style and comfort, all these vegan or sustainable sneaker labels could not match the brands that are often labeled as stylish. Not to mention the tree hugging image that many vegan fashion labels carry with them. 
We at QURC couldn't understand that there was such a strange taboo around vegan fashion and it was striking that no shoes were made that could match the big brands in terms of style and quality. Especially while there are so many alternatives to leather. Our sneakers are 100% vegan and handmade in a small well known factory in Portugal. Our purpose is to show you, that you don't have to compromise on style or comfort when leather is replaced by non-animal materials.

We make simplistic sneakers of very high quality for all occasions. We work with a minimalistic philosophy and create timeless essentials. 

We do not compromise on style. We do not compromise on comfort. And we do not compromise on image, although we use non-animal materials. We set the new standard.

In 2017, both set the course for the future with the opening of the new company building in Grosswallstadt and the gradual handover of operations to their sons David and Tobias Schellenberger. Together, the Schellenberger family is now leading the company to the next stage.

ragwear,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: ragwear DESCRIPTION: rag noun \ˈrag\
a worthless piece of cloth

wear verb \ˈwer\
to have on the person; to use for clothing

Because all we make are bits of cloth. It’s what you do in them that counts. Our brand is the result of a long journey – starting with skateboards, hoodies and denim, reaching an eye-opening shock moment when visiting the production facilities of our jeans and all the way to the resulting rebirth of ragwear as a vegan brand with a high sense of responsibility towards people and nature. In the past twenty years and more, ragwear has taken an exciting and sometimes rocky road.

Step by step into a responsible and sustainable future – we have started using sustainable and recycled materials, process denim in environmentally friendly production methods, have become a vegan fashion label and have improved the production and working conditions for our manufacturers. In the following we would like to tell you about our successes to date and the steps we are going to take in the future.

Recreative Apparel means committing to sustainable practices to create exciting fashion pieces that make people (and the planet) happy. It means redefining how we see and conduct ourselves. It means owning our uniqueness and celebrating the things that make us different. It means recreating the mold. There are 8 billion tons of plastic on the planet, and once it’s made, it never goes away. Not in your lifetime, your children’s lifetime, or your grandchildren’s lifetime. It floats in our oceans, damaging the reef and killing marine life. It piles up in landfills with the rest of our consumer waste, a permanent reminder of our cultural impulsiveness. It’s unsustainable, and it needs to stop-- we need to stop.

Until we find a way to eliminate the plastic we’ve created, we must do everything we can to keep it out of our landfills and oceans. Fortunately, we have a plan. You’ve probably heard of it: reduce, reuse, repurpose, recycle!

The aim here at Recreative Apparel is to create colourful, stylish, eco-friendly athleisure wear that is durable, functional, and sustainable. Our goal is to go out of business...leaving behind a planet without plastics. There are a lot of sustainable fashion brands out there, but we think we’re the only one that wants to run itself into the ground.

Founded in 1954 in New York City, the RefrigiWear brand was born from an intuition that led two American entrepreneurs to develop an absolute innovation in the workwear field. Knowing very well the needs of workers involved in hostile jobs and in very cold environments, such as the food refrigerated storage industry, they developed with the support of the newly born DuPont ™ textile fiber department, the first real innovation in the field of insulating clothing. The garments were initially called ""Weather-Alls"" and represented an alternative to wearing heavy and uncomfortable wool jackets as well as several layers of bulky undergarments. From that moment, the brand followed a path of rapid growth in the United States until the 90s when an expert and enthusiast of original American brands discovered RefrigiWear and began to import it initially in the Italian market, and subsequently throughout Europe and in the most particular Japanese research stores. In 2000s the ownership of the brand became Italian for a whole series of territories and from that day the RefrigiWear brand alternates between the workwear market still created by RefrigiWear Inc on American soil and the luxury fashion market today managed by RefrigiWear Distribution Srl, an Italian company with over 30 years' expertise in the global and retail fashion industry.

And we’re still doing it. Still thinking of new ways to help people, still inspired by the great outdoors and still hanging by the front door when you need us.
And it’s still what counts for the ramblers, amblers, hikers and bikers. campers and gardeners and daily commuters, dog walkers, show jumpers and multi-tasking mums, picnickers, backpackers, kids playing ball and dads at the footie, urban roamers and beachcombers and puddle-loving children and everyone else we’ve helped start their own adventure.
There were 12 of us
Now there are millions

Reinhard Frans,"['Footwear', 'Bags', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Reinhard Frans DESCRIPTION: The concept of Reinhard Frans started after a long family tradition of working with the absolute best manufactures of handmade shoes. In 2008 the dream was established by Reinhard and his sons. After a period of development the first Flagship Store was opened in Apeldoorn in 2012.

The competitive advantage of Reinhard Frans is the extremely efficient supply chain. All our activities are carried out in-house. We source our leathers from European tanneries. Our manufacturing is completely done in our factory by highly skilled shoemakers. Logistics are send directly to our shops with no distribution centers between us and the end customer. We operate from 10 stores throughout The Netherlands and Belgium. We manage all sales ourselves by selling directly to the end consumer. Our handmade collection is designed and developed by our production team. Through know-how and good cooperation with our suppliers, we are able to use the absolute best materials on the market. It is important for us that animals have lived under good conditions, which is why we always communicate with the tanneries where the leather is sourced from. In our atelier the designed ideas are combined with true artisanal craftsmanship to create wearable pieces of art.

Reinhard Frans offers a customization program to create a unique pair of handmade shoes. The customer is able to choose his style of shoe, the best fitting last, leathers to be used as well as suitable soles. This program is supported by a configurator online. This customization program is possible for classic shoes and our modern sneakers.

A unique feature of Reinhard Frans is the ‘Patina’. Our shoes are hand-colored by our artists in our atelier. Hand-Patinating is the most exclusive form of manually aging leather with pigments and dyes. Our Flagship Store in Amsterdam offers live patina in-store. Through monthly in-store events, we connect clients who are interested in this form as art. The world is dominated by mass consumption. Most large retail chains create supply chains to increase and influence the demand of consumers. This process will stop eventually. Human beings produce in such amounts that can’t be processed with sustainable methods. Reinhard Frans manufactures products by hand that are carefully made with the least amount of overproduction. Our mission is to implement traditional craftsmanship into modern times.

ReLace,"['Accessories', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: ReLace DESCRIPTION: By the end of 2020 two friends from Utrecht, Michael Colthoff and Niels de Regt, founded ReLace in response to a well-known problem: plastic.
With production facilities in the Netherlands, ReLace manufacturers sustainable laces for sneakers, sports- and outdoor shoes.

What is the problem? Well, plastic is the problem. Plastic production keeps growing. Year by year and on a worldwide scale. And what we all know is that plastic does not go away. The result: an ever-growing pile of plastic waste with horrible consequences for the environment, people and animals. ReLace takes a step in the right direction: every pair of laces sold means 10 plastic bottles are taken out of the environment. By collecting and recycling plastic bottles they are given a second life as laces. This way ReLace contributes in combatting plastic pollution, one step at a time.
They even look good, these laces.

At the moment, the product range consists of 5 sneakerlaces, 5 sportslaces and 1 outdoorlace. Custom-made and white label solutions are possible as well as several (sustainable) packaging options.

Replay,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Footwear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Replay DESCRIPTION: EANS ARE MORE THAN JUST A PIECE OF CLOTHING.
They do not only last for a season. Jeans blend with the body, are moulded by the body into an indissoluble whole, becoming one with the wearer in a sublime symbiosis. Jeans reflect just who we are – slipped on in seconds, shaped over the years as the fabric adapts to and enhances every single curve and fold. This is why they’re so sexy. This is why they’re still so rebellious, still a symbol of dressing and thinking outside the box. Above all, this is what makes them so unique. No two pairs are ever the same, just as no two people are ever the same. Yet there’s nothing haute couture or high class about jeans. They’re democratic. FASHION BOX SPA
Innovative flair, characteristic Italian design and the superb quality of its products, have always been three cornerstones of Fashion Box S.p.A.’s philosophy. In addition to distinctive skill and expertise, this has made the Italian group a major player in international denim styling and production. This combination of vast experience and advanced know-how, together with constant research for a unique style and sophisticated manufacturing techniques, makes up the intrinsic value of Fashion Box’s items of clothing. For this reason, the majority of the company’s investments is focussed on styling research and on R&D applied to manufacturing techniques especially in terms of eco-sustainability and respect for the environment 

Trading under the brands REPLAY, REPLAY&SONS, and WE ARE REPLAY, the Italian group creates, promotes and distributes casual wear, accessories and footwear for men, women and children. Brand extension projects, including eyewear and the Replay perfume lines, are entrusted to license partners. In 1978 visionary entrepreneur Claudio Buziol registered the Replay brand. In 1981 he founded the company Fashion Box based in the hilltop town of Asolo (Treviso), a place of worldwide renown for creativity, which has been the synonym for the highest standards in the denim sector for more than 30 years. Since its foundation, Fashion Box has developed, and stuck to, its key strategy: product vision, expansion into new markets and increasing control of the distribution network. As a result, Fashion Box is now prominent in all European markets, the Middle East, Asia, America and Africa in over 50 countries, with the wholesale and shop in shop distribution network boasting 4,000 sales outlets with 105 retail stores and 125 corners.

Reykjavik Raincoats,"['Menswear', 'Womenswear']","BRAND: Reykjavik Raincoats DESCRIPTION: Joy in a Raincoat !

The idea for Reykjavik Raincoats sprang to our minds in the way of most brilliant ideas, in a shower...of rain that is. It rains more than 200 days out of the year in Iceland so if we were to let a little bit of rain stop us, nothing would ever get done. And so it was that we found ourselves standing in a downpour after a night of bar-hopping, waiting in line at the famous hotdog stand Bæjarins Bestu, as one does if you live in Reykjavik. With a multitude of raindrops dripping from our hair and the rain seeping into our clothes and shoes we realized: It would be great to have a raincoat that would not only keep you dry but also make you look good, no matter the occasion. At first, all we had was a name: Reykjavik Raincoats. It’s an homage to the brand’s birthplace where you will find Reykjavikians resignedly walking the streets of downtown, or 101 as we call it, in rain, sleet, snow and...more rain. In the spirit of making it work no matter the weather and looking good while you do it we set out to make the perfect raincoat, the raincoat that sparks joy in your spirit when the gloomy clouds outside would have you feel otherwise.

We made a conscious decision that Reykjavik Raincoats would be handmade, using the best possible materials. Something well made would be long-lasting and need to withstand fickle fashion trends so we decided on a vintage style. Once we found our manufacturing partner in Europe we were ready to make a splash in the raincoat puddle.

At first, it was more of a gentle step than a splash in the puddle but we’ve grown from selling primarily to family and friends to selling in multiple shops, including our own showroom and design studio. We’re busily adding more colours and styles to the collection, ensuring there will be a steady supply of raincoats that make you want to go outside and dance for joy in the rain.

In keeping with the family-business environment, his sons Denis and Patrick Stupp took over the company in 2002. Four years after joining into the family business, they saw a gap in the market high-quality, rock ‘n’ roll-oriented outfits and founded the Rich & Royal brand in 2006.

Rock Crystal,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear']","BRAND: Rock Crystal DESCRIPTION: Rock Crystal is a luxurious and casual clothing brand created by designer Lionel Attias.

The brand is inspired by the energy of stones and more particularly by the power of rock crystal, recognized for its transformative power, which invites peace, develops trust and promotes action.

A journey that Lionel Attias knows well, he who has already lived several lives before Rock Crystal! In the 1990s, he founded his women's ready-to-wear brand and dresses many international celebrities. But after 18 years at the head of his label, in full rise, he faces a health test that forces him to retire to take care of himself. From this milestone event, he will realize that we all have the ability in ourselves to reconnect with our inner strength and draw from it the energy necessary to get up and bounce back. In his journey, he discovers the benefits of stones and their ability to emit unique vibrations that reactivate our power. From then on, he has an obsession in mind, reconnecting with his passion for fashion and creating a new brand as a new start. Its objective is to share his conviction with as many people as possible: we all have the power to calm down and find the necessary impetus to carry out projects that are important to us.

« I became interested in the energy of stones by launching Rock Crystal. I wanted to create clothes with extra soul, clothes loaded with the energies of rock crystal, carrying inspiring messages and boosting self-esteem. »

In lithotherapy, rock crystal is one of the most important protective stones. It harmonizes energies, brings clarity and strengthens intuition.

That's why we wanted to share this talisman stone with you and you will find on each Rock Crystal garment, a fragment of rock crystal slipped into a small natural cotton pouch. Keep it with you, make an intention about how you want it to accompany you and create your change!

Never forget this: You are never given a test that you cannot overcome!

or not to do when you are a woman...It's not easy to find your way around.

Why should there be rules? 
What if you were simply allowed to be you? 
Be every day and every night who you are. 
Sensual, natural, modest, sophisticated, wise and mysterious... It doesn't matter! You are you!
And that's the only thing that matters.

to themselves, authentic, assumed, soothed, and contributes every day to the happiness of being a woman.

RUBY TUESDAY,"['Womenswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: RUBY TUESDAY DESCRIPTION: Don't question why she needs to be so free.

She'll tell you it's the only way to be.

Keith Richards wrote the Rolling Stones hit song Ruby Tuesday back in 1966 in a Los Angeles hotel room. The sweet serenade to his ex girlfriend Linda Keith, who had left him to chase Jimi Hendrix, would not only make it to become one of the greatest songs of all time, it is also the never ending source of inspiration for RUBY TUESDAY founder Sanne Christiaansen. Translated to their educated Northern European fashion sensitivity, RUBY TUESDAY marries the traditionally sophisticated, yet rock-‘n-roll infused street style of now generation Parisiennes such as Lou Doillon, Caroline de Maigret and Clémence Poésy, with the crisp and smart timelessness of Scandinavian fashion.

It’s RUBY TUESDAY’s ambition to deliver instantly covetable wardrobe staples in this vein. A tribute to all those women around the globe who deserve a number one hit song written in their name too.

The first garments were fashioned in an old brick building in the heart of Montreal's garment district. Collections came to life in RUDSAK's atelier, home to every stage from the selection of finest leathers to the skilled handiwork of trained craftspeople for over 25 years, the RUDSAK brand has been anchored by a cool rebellious spirit, traveling seamlessly between art, music and design, adding new layers of meaning with each new line.

Located in Montreal, Canada, the privately owned company's head office is the birthplace of all RUDSAK designs. Whether it's a classic leather jacket, elevated outerwear or innovative knits and sportswear, the artful inspiration continues to flow.

Russell Athletic,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear']","BRAND: Russell Athletic DESCRIPTION: Russell Athletic is a sport fashion brand. The label exists for over 100 years and belongs to Russel Brands LCC. Since its creation in 1902, Russell Athletics is dedicated to bringing the best designed apparel for all athletes. Nowadays, the company is focused in sponsoring minor leagues and universities. Russel Atheltics is currently the sponsor of all the teams of the Arena Football League, Little League Baseball and of the Harlem Globetrtotters basketball team. From the inventor of the sweatshirt, Russell Athletic has revolutionised the way we dress through the fashionisation of authentic American varsity style over its 120 year history. For Autunn/Winter 2023, Russell Athletic stays a step ahead in streetwear by making its men's and women's collections unisex with fits, silhouettes and design details that blur the gender divide.

The brand's iconic sweatshirt is the focus of the collection: made in quality iersey and fluid shapes that drape to an oversized look for women and present a softer alternative for men. Paired with these are lean track and gently flared jazz pants with sartorial details such as double-rib ankle cuffs, draw-cord waistbands and side pockets. Hoodies with large front pouches along with zip-through gilets and nostalgic bomber jackets complete this range offorever garments for modern lifestyles.

Every new Russell Athletic collection brings a fresh take on its famous Eagle R logo and the enduring iconography of American collegiate culture. For this season, the brand has developed a variety of graphic expressions, formats and techniques- from jacquard to multi-coloured embroideries and non-PVC prints that render the designs with an on-trend artisanal quality. The leitmotif of the collection is the return of the tiger, an image that formed part of the early archive of Russell Athletic American college football apparel.

In the same spirit, the chromatic palette for Autumn/Winter 2023 swings between the classic collegiate tones of navy blue, grey mélange and ivory to ash blue, dill green, woody yellows, new browns as well as crafted tie- dye finishes. Strong on detail and high in quality, Russell Athletic once again combines the brand's inherent authenticity with a fashion-forward ethos to bring an exciting new proposal in unisex casualwear for Autumn/Winter 2023.",https://www.russellathletic.com,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.924, 'pos': 0.076, 'compound': 0.9769}",0.9769,Positive,en

Sal Parasuco,['Menswear'],"BRAND: Sal Parasuco DESCRIPTION: BEYOND THE DENIM FRONTIER
For nearly 50 years, Parasuco has produced legendary denim.
The innovative introduction of stretch, the silhouette-enhancing styles, the contemporary attitude, the bold brand image – all reflecting the trailblazing vision of founder, Sal Parasuco.
​
With the exclusive debut of SP Sal Parasuco Collection at Pitti Immagine Uomo, Parasuco and incoming creative director, Tu Ly, present the most forward-leaning and emblematic expression of the brand to date. SP Sal Parasuco will launch with two highly distinctive and complementary offers: a signature denim capsule arriving for Spring ’24 and new, luxury outerwear that will be available for Winter ’24. Sal Parasuco was born in Italy and grew up in Montreal, where the brand is located. He began experimenting with denim in the early ’70s using his parents' washing machine from concept to actual jeans. In 1975, he made his foray into fashion with Santana Jeans. As business expanded internationally, he rebranded to Parasuco Jeans in 1988. Over several decades, for denim collectors and industry experts alike, the name Parasuco has remained a reference for figure-flattering jeans branded with a chimera logo. Today, a coiling SP logo in metal nods to the serpent of the chimera’s tail while reaffirming his unwavering passion.

Sarvin,['Womenswear'],"BRAND: Sarvin DESCRIPTION: Sarvin is an international luxury clothing brand, specialising in creating distinctive and high-quality garments handpicked from the finest fabrics and materials.

We imbue each design with our signature flair for fashion and eye for detail – the result is an irresistible collection of contemporary wardrobe staples and show-stopping timeless pieces.  
We design and produce the majority of our garments in the UK to lower the carbon emissions by reducing the shipping distances, supporting local artisans to be able to monitor our manufacturing process closely.
We strongly believe modern luxury should be socially and environmentally responsible; therefore we take into consideration where our materials come from and who is making them, to ensure our customers are receiving highly ethically sustainable garments that will last them a lifetime. - A PERSIAN LOVE STORY
At Sarvin we love combining the best of two worlds; Persian and English to create sophisticated looks with a touch of Persian history and classic British silhouettes that will be your wardrobe staples for years to come.

From day one our primary focus has been attention to detail and quality materials by using sustainable and eco-friendly fabrics that will not just look good but feel amazing on the body too.
We handpick every single fabric in our collection, and we work very closely with our manufacturers and dressmakers to ensure our customers are receiving highly ethically sustainable garments that will last them a lifetime.

- A JOURNEY TO SARVIN WORLD
Sarvin is a Persian girl who grew up in a family where fashion was one of the most discussed topics in the house. She always dreamed about having her own company and creating an exclusive collection that will enhance sophistication with a play of textures, patterns and details. 
After finishing her master's degree in International Fashion Marketing, she worked in a variety of companies as an intern to gain experience and learn more about the business aspect of the fashion industry. 

In 2015, Sarvin launched her first fashion collection which has been influenced by her Iranian heritage with a twist of modern British style. She has been published in Vogue, House of Coco and other well-known magazines, since she has been growing her stockists worldwide and continuing to expand her brand internationally.

- LUXURY MEETS SUSTAINABILITY
Our latest collection is made from recycled cotton linters which is a waste product from the textile industry. The process used to produce the fibre is a 'closed loop' which means the chemicals used can be extracted after and reused.

We are proud to consider Sarvin as the first few independent luxury labels in the UK which have produced garments out of these sustainable materials.

The fabric is known for its silk-like properties being incredibly soft, and its temperature adaptable.

Our partnered fabric company is the first V-Labelled textile producer in the world, and the European Vegetarian Union certifies their yarns to be corresponded with the guidelines of the European Vegetarian Label and categorised in the Vegan V-Label.

We have taken this collection to the next level by launching our first ever exclusive print designs which are hand drawn paintings from a famous Persian artist Ali Fani Salek printed over these eco-friendly materials. Thus, the fabric used in this collection has a lower environmental impact than conventional fabrics, and it drapes heavenly over the body.

SAXX,,"BRAND: SAXX DESCRIPTION: Our story starts in 2006, when our founder asked: why can’t men’s underwear be better? After spending hours on a fishing trip in a clammy ocean suit, he wondered if there was a way to fend off the uncomfortable effects of chafing and friction down south. The answer was SAXX. Simply put, this is underwear designed differently. Our technologies move with you and deliver revolutionary comfort every step of the way.

Thanks in large part to the patented BallPark Pouch™ – our defining piece of internal tech – men now know that underwear isn’t just an afterthought. It’s the foundation of a comfortable and distraction-free day

Scarpa,"['Footwear', 'Sportswear']","BRAND: Scarpa DESCRIPTION: Innovation and tradition share equally deep roots at SCARPA, which to this day remains a family owned company with its headquarters and performance footwear manufacturing facilities in the same regions of northern Italy where it got its start in 1938. Founded in the foothills of the Dolomite Mountains, in the Asolo / Montebelluna region, an area long known for its quality, handcrafted footwear, SCARPA’s initial mission was to bring together all the best shoemakers in the Asolo area toward the goal of producing the best footwear anywhere. SCARPA stands for Società Calzaturiera Asolana Riunita Pedemontana Anonima, which means Associated Shoe Manufacturing Company of the Asolo Mountain Area.

It was immersed in this tradition of craftsmanship and heritage that Luigi Parisotto, who would eventually purchase the company with his brothers and grow it into a family enterprise, first began learning the art of making fine footwear. Parisotto began learning his craft at age 11 in 1940 and went to work for SCARPA in 1942. From the beginning, Parisotto loved the process of building handcrafted footwear, and in the early 1950s ran his own shoe-manufacturing business, S. Giorgio, with his brothers, turning out between four and 15 pairs of handmade shoes a day. These were sold to local farmers who sought out shoes that were both comfortable and indestructible.

In 1956, Parisotto and three of his brothers, with the assistance of their family, pulled together enough money to make an offer on SCARPA. It was accepted and the business quickly grew under their leadership to encompass 17 expert shoemakers , and expanded during these early years to produce 50 to 60 pairs a day. In the late 1950s, word about SCARPA’s quality began to spread more widely outside the Montebelluna region and they attracted clientele from many other parts of northern Italy.

Schneiders,"['Menswear', 'Womenswear']","BRAND: Schneiders DESCRIPTION: Schneider’s 1.0: Old Tradition and New Fashion

The tailor’s new clothes. It all began in 1946 with a dozen patterns, the right feeling for the spirit of the times and coat production using the latest manufacturing methods. The coats and jackets from Schneiders quickly became successful products. In addition to time-tested techniques, the label relies on robust materials and timeless designs. The breakthrough for the clothing manufacturer came with the famous Dirtl trench, one of the first fashion export hits made in Salzburg. In particular, the weather resistance of the models made of rolled loden, woven linen, or the finest cashmere left a lasting mark on the brand DNA. In no time, Dirtl, Hubertus, and Co. became favorite companions of the coming seasons and (!) generations.

The concept of heritage and future. As the heir to the company, the Schneiders family creates its own fashion empire around the prominent coats. Schneiders produces premium Austrian products that combine traditional style quotes from the past with modern demands for quality and comfort. In just under eight decades, the family business, with heritage, craftsmanship and individuality as its driving forces, develops into an internationally celebrated label with cult status. Schneiders 2.0.: From the Dirtl Trench to vegan Micro Down

Coming to stay. In 2018, Wolfgang Binder takes over the fortunes of the clothing manufacturer. Like his predecessor, he relies on the (long-) established design team, whose know-how is passed down from generation to generation. In addition to the tried-and-tested ingredients of authenticity, craftsmanship and exclusivity, the new Schneiders CEO focuses on sustainability. For Wolfgang Binder, sustainability is generated both by the materials used and by the idea of transporting values into the modern age.

Beyond mass-produced goods. By tradition, Schneiders reinterprets fine natural characteristics every season. With straightforward designs and timeless clothing, the brand stands up to the fast fashion brands. Technological uncharted territory is just as central to the renowned fashion manufacturer as the transparency offered with regard to the manufacturing processes. Of course, the brand’s high standards come at a price. However, those responsible for the product believe in the potential of a quality-conscious target group. One thing is certain: Schneiders fabrics will continue to be able to do more than dress elegantly in the future.

New paths. Wolfgang Binder’s entrepreneurial goals create a refreshing relevance to the requirements of a modern clientele. Furthermore, making production chains and raw materials visible is just as much part of the agenda as introducing digital sales structures. With a promising store concept, the label brings nature into the urban space. In just under 300 square meters of sales space, the customer encounters an imaginary Schneiders world – in the middle of Salzburg’s Old Town. Characteristic brand elements tell of the journey to authentic values, adventures in nature, and first-class Austrian fashion.

Eclectic and modern, our playful designs redefine everyday dressing. We dare to match the unmatchable to deliver our authentically Amsterdam aesthetic, boldly clashing colours, prints and textures.

Our collections are grounded in an appreciation of the classics: a white shirt, workwear chino, trucker jacket or timeless leather bomber, which we then rework with irreverent details into looks that are all our own.

Beautiful as our designs are, we believe they shouldn’t cost the earth. As part of our commitment to becoming a more responsible and transparent company, we’re focused on reducing our environmental footprint by making smarter choices every day.

Our history
Established in 1985 first as a menswear brand in Amsterdam, our collections now include women, kids, denim, fragrances and accessories, occupying a unique space in the global fashion landscape of today.

Our boys’ range arrived in 2008 and was the first to pioneer ‘mini-me’ dressing, applying the same exacting craftsmanship as our men’s line. Womenswear was added in 2009 after women were spotted in our men’s clothes, underlining the inclusive nature of our designs.

2010 marked several firsts, including a new girls’ range, as well as a premium denim line. In the same year, we also unveiled Barfly, our now-iconic unisex fragrance.

Today, we continue to experiment with collections that embody freedom and creativity. Most recently, we launched footwear and eyewear, as well as two perfumes, our Scotch & Soda signature, and its newest iteration, Island Water, which celebrates the spirit of endless summer.

Our designs can now be found at over 7,000 selected retailers worldwide, including 247 standalone stores in unexpected corners of the world’s biggest cities such as New York, London and Paris. We also ship online to over 70 countries.

Sea Me Happy,"['Womenswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Sea Me Happy DESCRIPTION: As a young child Noémie grew up in Belgium. Travelling around the world with her parents, triggered her desire to embrace new cultures and to seek adventure. After her studies as an interior designer in Antwerp she was eager to spread her wings. It was Damien, her boyfriend whom she met at Tomorrowland, that led her to Cape Town. Together they started working on boats and resorts in tropical waters. Always in pursuit of freedom and a new journey, she felt deeply inspired by the colours of the jungle, by the stories of fellow Free Spirit travellers and by the kindness of so many Airbnb-hosts along the way. Travelling and doing what you love became her main goal in life. Being creative on a small scale in a world that is overwhelmed by mass production sure is a challenge. But the feedback and the support of so many friends and strangers from all over the globe, is the biggest reward there is. 

Ever since participating in a small designers-fair at the university where she studied, things started to bloom in a natural way. Beautiful Belgian boutiques began to sell the hand-made-with-love items, and this webshop is the next step to reach out to you, our tribe around the world!

Home of the original colour changing swim shorts. Like all great things in life, we’ve been copied and imitated, but never truly replicated. This is our story. DESIGNED AND MADE IN EUROPE
At SEA’SONS we’re innovating with smart materials, technology and creative design. By combining technology and fashion we’re offering our customers fun, excitement, surprise, and wonder because we know that this can make our product even more valuable.

We are proud to offer you the highest quality products out there and we manufacture exclusively in Europe.

HOW IT STARTED
The SEA'SONS adventure started because there was a need for something exciting and different in the swimwear industry. 

It took us quite a while to develop these unique color changing swim trunks. Once we’d made them we wanted to make sure everyone could wear them. So, we took our concept to Kickstarter!

AND THEN, SOMETHING AMAZING HAPPENED

We kept receiving tons of photos and videos from people wearing our swim shorts and they were all smiling like crazy... That’s when we understood that our product had made our customers really happy, and that meant a lot to us.

Of course, we can bring that same feeling to much more than just swim shorts. That’s why we’ve decided to expand the brand. We want to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to experience that SEA’SONS feeling, not just in summer but all year long

The Seidenfelt models are lovingly designed and developed in Dinslaken. The production is placed trustfully in the hands of selected, long-standing partners.

Polyurethane is a water-based artificial leather that does not contain animal products and is fully recyclable. Goods made of this material are particularly tear-resistant and robust but still elastic. Dirt can be easily removed with a damp cloth.

The Seidenfelt bags are a symbiosis of Scandinavian, reduced design and feminine street style look. In addition, all models combine optimal wearing comfort, functionality and a trendy style. The Seidenfelt bags are available through the Seidenfelt online shop, through selected online retailers and in retail.

Being a child is about having dreams. Being an adult is about realising them. This could easily be the motto of Paul Zemmour, the founder of the Sergent Major brand.

From the cuts to the quality of the fabrics, the attention paid to the finishes and details, and the harmony of the colours, the outfits created and the prices of each piece are a reflection of the brand's values and have contributed to its success worldwide.

From a dream came a story. From this story many others will be born. Our values

The brand is founded by a young woman called Roxanne, who always has been passionate about fashion and designing handbags. In her late 20’s (after gaining experience in the field) she decided it was time to create her own brand. Since Roxanne has a mixed heritage and comes from the Netherlands and Spain, she felt it was very important to try and find leather artisans in Spain. After a long and extensive search she found the perfect match.

Shahini Fakhourie,['Womenswear'],"BRAND: Shahini Fakhourie DESCRIPTION: Shahini Fakhourie is an emerging black-owned minimalist, high-end streetwear design brand with a concentration in art, fashion sustainability. Shahini first recognized her passions in this field when her grandmother taught her how to sew, a time when sheer fabrics and patent leathers took the fashion world by storm. Her continued acknowledgment regarding the lack of women-led, high-end streetwear brands also propels her craft. Shahini Fakhourie’s design process starts with one central idea: always allowing form and function to guide her journey. Her inspiration stems from design internships completed in New York City including, freelance children and accessories design for Tommy Hilfiger, an interview and events writer for Haute Living Magazine, 944 Magazine, and a Saks Fifth Avenue Handbag Specialist along with graduating from Miami International University of Art and Design and Academy Art University with a concentration in fashion. These unique experiences sprouted her admiration towards brands such as Tom Ford and Rei Kawakubo. Fakhourie’s structural process is about continuity to guide her brand’s representation, even though each collection varies across all areas, including materials, techniques, and work exhibitions.

Fakhourie drives her brand forward through applied technologies, simultaneously sticking to her core beliefs of fashion sustainability, affordability, quality, and transparency while delving into the past to create a women’s capsule collection, bold and innovative as its wearer, which is the Shahini Fakhourie ethos.

Shahini Fakhourie is based in Miami, Florida.

The name retraces the dream for explorations on motorcycles hunting for beautiful and forgotten spots, in a word, searching for the Shangri-La.
Heritage comes from the need to create iconic and timeless garments, inspired by the past.

Designed for Bikers, Rockers and Gentlemen. The company founders are always on the road looking for new adventures, discovering places, meeting up people who share their interests and getting to know new fabric types and manufacturing techniques, valuable to keep their products up-to-date.
“By riding our motorbikes through Europe we come across sensational places and interesting heads. We tie up pleasure and business to offer the best quality-goods”, ends in style Daniel Verzeroli.

""We believe in Quality, Craftsmanship, Passion, and Traditional Techniques.""

Every garment we make is the most authentic expression of our values.
From the moment you step foot in the workshop and see the artisans at work, you can feel the sense of creativity and humanity of this place.
They’ve been doing what they love for more than 40 years, with passion and using the same traditional techniques.

In a world where everything is mass-produced, we’re turning back the clocks: we’ve chosen to invest our time, skills, and experience to highlight the Italian craftsmanship through the beauty of our products, in our identity.

Our products are inspired by the iconic garments from the last Century, revisited with a unique Italian touch. They are synonymous with a flawless blend of superior craft skills, timelessness, attention to detail, and versatility.
They are an authentic portrayal of Italian excellence, our heritage, they combine manual work and creativity elevating the art of craftsmanship at its finest.

From top quality Steerhide to Front Quarter pull-up Horsehide, from Selvedge Denim to Recycled Kilim Wool, we personally source all of our leathers and fabrics directly from small producers around Italy and Europe.
We offer all our clients a personalized experience. We accompany them with a tailored approach whether purchasing ready to wear or commissioning a Made-to-Measure jacket, or creating an entirely custom bespoke piece.

The company is an extension of Western Glove Works, which was founded by the first generation Silver family in 1921 and holds the spot as the oldest privately held denim producer in North America. Translation: the Silvers have been designing denim for nearly a century. So yeah, you could say we know a thing or two about jeans.

Fit is at the core of everything we do, and it has been from the get-go. Our first silhouette, a unisex jean called the ""Frisco,"" launched in 1991 and went on to sell 2 million pairs. And that was just the beginning. Since then, our collection has expanded to include a variety of fits for literally every body. Straight, curvy, tall, short, slim, muscular or somewhere in between, our men’s, women’s and plus size lines integrate every iteration of a jean imaginable. Seriously. And it helps that our design team is made of real people, with real bodies, of all shapes and sizes. So we’re not just designing jeans for you, we’re designing them for ourselves. We live in our Silvers, and we think you should, too.

Our roots in workwear mean quality and craft is in our genes (pun intended). With an emphasis on skill and unrivaled attention to detail, our denim is built to last—premium, high-quality fabrics, reinforced stitching techniques, rivets and buttons with incredible strength. Our jeans are crafted with integrity, authenticity and most of all, sustainability. While other pairs you own might end up in a landfill, ours will live in your drawer for years to come, and like some of the best things, get even better with age.

Simmons Bilt,['Menswear'],"BRAND: Simmons Bilt DESCRIPTION: Simmons Bilt started manufacturing leather jackets in Oakland, California in the early 1900’s and ceased trading in the late 1930’s, they were regarded as one of the early pioneers in the production of leather jackets. They were also an early adopter of the new “zips closure” and used the ball & chain puller as their preference. Simmons Bilt created some great leather jackets that today are very rare to find. Through extensive research we managed to find enough information in the archives to enable us to form a template to emulate the craftsmanship employed back in the day at Simmons Bilt. Simmons Bilt Clothing Company combines the spirit of heritage and authenticity using traditional craftsmanship, a tip of the hat to the artisans of old. Our purpose is to create classic vintage inspired outerwear garments with everyday functionality and fit for the more discerning customer. Each and every garment is individually produced here in our own factory by one single craftsman.We only use only the highest quality materials available to us, traditional craftsmanship with a focus on exceptional attention to detail, the result being a garment built for life that will develop character the more it is worn.

We appreciate that as The Simmons Bilt Clothing Company we have reinvigorated a name of pedigree and distinction, not to be taken lightly and our focus will be to pay homage to this early pioneering manufacturer through our quality and integrity. 

We continually review and modify our patterns, based on materials used and customer feedback, we also introduced some time ago into our team, time served pattern technicians, experts in their field, to work alongside our specialists ensuring the end product is a fusion of classic vintage style and contemporary functionality and fit.This together with sourcing new materials and hardware that is both befitting of such a prestigious name but also hardwearing so the garments we build today are still around for decades to come.

There are many manufacturers who produce garments to the exact specifications employed back in 30’s & 40’s, and there are some great examples out there to be admired. However, we are a continually evolving progressive company with aspirations to build on our portfolio year on year and rather than a focus on recreating exactly the styles of yesteryear we use vintage inspiration to produce garments that are relevant today.

Sisters Point,"['Womenswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Sisters Point DESCRIPTION: Aarhus-based Sisters Point were founded during the fall of 1994 by Allan Freivald. The dream was to create a new and young brand, which would do something different than designing and producing two annual collections. Sisters Point skipped the annual collections and simply just focused on designing and producing trending styles. No collections simply just trends on time. Back in the nineties Allan Freiwald often made his way around Paris, Milan, London and Amsterdam and he sensed that the fashion scene was changing and it was moving towards a more young and fresh look. Daughters shouldn't look like their mothers but instead go with their own style and look. The fashion trends was moving towards lycra, low waists, bare bellies, strong colours and patterns combined with mini skirts and small dresses. All the mentioned styles and trends soon became the core of SisterS point and helped establish the brand on the scandinavian fashion scene. When Spice Girls had their major breakthrough in 1996 they manifested the young and fresh style and Sisters Point was definitely not going anywhere.

Today we still focus on designing, producing and selling the right styles for the trendy girl and woman. Sisters Point is always focusing on capturing the large international fashion tendencies and then convert them into cool and trendy streetwear - which fits perfect into the danish style, look and fashion philosophy.

Sisters Point designs ready-to-wear. Designed to fit the customers needs and not because it is supposed to fit into an overall collection theme. We always design with three types in mind: The Classy, the feminine and the sporty - which means, that all of our drops contain styles and items for those three types. Our drops are designed to match exactly those vibes and looks that are trending right now. No matter what we are designing we insist on keeping our universe playful and always work with a colour palette of soft colours which goes perfectly well with our airy and soft qualities and preppy mix.

Sisters Point doesn't design collections on a monthly basis but we move as soon as we feel a vibe. This means that you can always find new styles online and at the same time we promise to always keep you updated on the latest trends from the international fashion scene.

SKURK Kids Clothing,['Kidswear'],"BRAND: SKURK Kids Clothing DESCRIPTION: From DREAMING to DARING and DOING. Inspired by rebels, SKURK celebrates the freedom to discover. SKURK strives to dress every boy anywhere in the world in its comfy and sturdy collections. SKURK boys are rebellious and love adventure and mischief to discover the world. SKURK means little rebel in the Scandinavian language. The owners Helga and Marlou started 5 years ago with a new boys brand, clothing available in size 92 to 164. This after years of working (together) at major retailers in the fashion industry. This is already proving to be the right step. Based on their passion, they are conquering the Netherlands and Belgium and want to cross the border more. The first stores in Denmark and Canada are already down and are buying SKURK. They also had to expand internally in order to cope with the growth.
The mix of comfortable wearing comfort, a good fit and the best quality of fabrics appeals to both boys and parents. Parents want value for money and get it at SKURK. Pants, shorts, t-shirts and sweaters last for several seasons even in everyday use without losing the colours and fabrics. The boys always choose SKURK when they stand in front of their (wardrobe) closet because the clothes are so comfy. Whether it’s going to go to school, play football in the park, jump trampoline or climb trees.
The uniqueness of the brand is also in being able to combine the items in an infinite way. This makes choosing an outfit easypeasy, both for the parents (especially for the daddy’s 😉) and for the boys. It is understandable that SKURK is growing strongly.
Then we haven’t even mentioned the unique prints and techniques that are used.
And ow yes! SKURK designs everything in the Netherlands and produces in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way. SKURK considers delivering honest products a must, especially in the present time and world in which we live. The suppliers from Portugal and India stand for continuous improvement in the production process and meet all standards. SKURK is also committed to good working conditions in its factories.

Andre started with a multi brand store on the leliegracht in Amsterdam, where he mainly sold clothing as well shoes and bags.

Finding the best brands for his store wasn’t that difficult but finding nice quality bags was an issue, either the quality was not up to standard or just not the right models, and if he did find the perfect bags, they would just be too expensive!

That’s when Andre thought to himself “why don’t I design and produce my own bags?”. The goal was to design and produce bags that were of high quality, beautifully designed and were able to compete with the bigger fashion brands!

Don’t be mistaken that was easier said than done, after 2 years of hard work and disappointments Andre got his collection started, and before too long Smaak Amsterdam was born!! Andre hadn't just designed a bag, he created an entire collection!

Smitten,"['Accessories', 'Bags', 'Jewelry']","BRAND: Smitten DESCRIPTION: SMITTEN means ""torn, enchanted"" in the American. And that's exactly how I feel when I discover traditional, authentic patterns, colors, materials - in short, the beauties of ethnic craftsmanship all over the world. It all started when I worked for twelve years in London and the USA as an art director for an international book publisher for lifestyle books. At trade fairs in the USA, I discovered beautiful handmade products from different countries.
When I was back in Germany and wore embroidered belts Peru belts from Peru, I was approached by women about the beautiful belts and I realized that I was not the only fan. As a graphic designer, it was not difficult for me to design a website with my finds, on which I also depicted the belt. It didn't take long and the first fashion boutiques wanted to include these colorful eye-catchers in their offer. This was followed by my first CPD fair in Düsseldorf, where I presented the first Peru belts and received many orders - the Smitten wholesale and webshop was born.

Snow Peak,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Sportswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Snow Peak DESCRIPTION: In 1958, Snow Peak was founded by Yukio Yamai in the Niigata Prefecture of Japan. After returning to his hometown after World War II, Yukio found solace in climbing Mt. Tanigawa, known for its treacherous and rugged terrain. He repeatedly challenged himself on its mountainside and was rejuvenated by the pure experience under the open sky. He wrote in his journal:

“We link our lives together by a single rope, and it gives us such a beautiful sense of trust in each other. It is such a pure thing. If we could capture the feeling and harness it for the good of society, certainly everything bad or evil would fall away.” 

Yamai was dissatisfied with the climbing gear available. So, he founded a climbing equipment company that would become Snow Peak, creating his own line of mountaineering products leveraging the skilled metal craftsman in his hometown of Tsubame-Sanjo. To this day, the dramatic landscape of Niigata inspires Snow Peak products and serves as home to Snow Peak’s Global Headquarters.

Horizontal Wear, day and night.
Our Horizontal Wear is a mix between PJ’s and lounge wear. Super comfortable clothing that you can wear day or night, inside or outside – it's your party.

The fit? Relaxed of course.
Our fit is designed to let you relax in style. The fabric is soft and stretchy, the cut is loose and relaxed, but never looks sloppy. Cuddling up in long sleeves in winter. Dresses that are light and loose in summer. And where possible, we add deep pockets. New styles appear in each collection, but our sweaters, trousers and dresses keep the same fit.

Producing consciously, wasting as little as possible.
It should just be normal for a textile company to produce in the most humane and environmentally friendly way possible. In any case, SNURK does everything it can.

Within de EU
We produce in Portugal. They make beautiful, quality products, work within EU rules (which means workers are better protected) and are close to us in Amsterdam. So no flying or shipping products long distances and limited mileage for the trucks.

GOTS certified
We work exclusively with GOTS certified organic cotton. GOTS is an organization that applies the strictest standards for organic fibers worldwide. They ensure the entire production process from fibre to finished product is as clean as possible.

Let’s celebrate the art of doing absolutely nothing.

Sock My Feet,['Bodywear'],"BRAND: Sock My Feet DESCRIPTION: Distinctive prints are and will always be fashion statements in today's fashion scene. 
But which garment is usually skipped? THE SOCK. And what is an outfit without tasteful, sustainable, distinctive and not unimportantly comfortable socks?
In 2017, we, three young Dutch entrepreneurs, we took the plunge and started developing, resulting in the launch of the brand Sock My Feet in 2018. 
We are now active in 15 countries and have recently expanded our brand with matching underwear called 'Untouched Underwear'. 
Our collections are shaped by three core values: 
""Distinctive prints"", ""Sustainability"" and ""Quality & comfort"". Distinctive prints

We provide our socks and underwear with prints with a classy and rebellious ""tone of voice"" for every ""mood"" and ""mindset"". You have to dare to wear our socks. Our prints are recognisable, stylish and at times provocative.

Sustainability

The fashion industry has a bad name when it comes to sustainability. This is because the sector is the second largest water user in the world! 
Sock My Feet changed the game in the spirit of 'one small sustainable sock for you, one giant leap for our planet'.
We want to show that clothes can be produced in a responsible way for people and nature, in contrast to 'fast fashion'. We focus on finding an alternative to constant consumption and use environmentally friendly and recycled materials that last longer. Our socks are made in a textile factory in Istanbul, a family business that is SMETA and Oeko-Tex certified and where working conditions are safe and fair.
These promising words need some explanation.
Dyeing and treating textiles in today's textile industry is responsible for about twenty percent of the world's polluted water.
After years of development, we have now succeeded in producing high-quality prints on organic cotton. This means no pesticides and insecticides in cotton cultivation and no chemicals, heavy metals and chemical cleaning agents in the processing. Moreover, organic cotton is firmer, softer and more breathable, and

reduces the risk of allergies and eczema. By printing, we save 90% of water consumption compared to the traditional colouring of yarns.
By using only natural organic cotton as raw material for our socks, we reduce water consumption by 90% compared to conventionally grown cotton.

The recycled polyamide made by REPREVE comes from old garments. Global market leader in recycled material and clothing.

Quality & comfort 
Besides stylish prints and durable production, quality & comfort complete the sock. The socks are always seamless and breathable due to the use of organic materials. A lot of attention has been paid to the knitting of the cuff, which should not pinch but also not be loose. The cuffs of our socks are therefore made using a special piquet knitting technique. When worn, the prints always remain razor-sharp without visible elastic due to our patented deep print technique. Our prints are also applied through a 360-degree technique. The print is therefore applied all around the sock and not printed flat on both sides. Even after frequent wear and washing, the prints remain beautiful without discolouration. We can therefore proudly state that our socks are made to last.

Plastic Soup Foundation
We are aware that sustainable production alone is not enough and that the shipping of all our products also affects our ecological footprint. Besides our sustainable production chain, we want to compensate the C02 emissions of our shipments by contributing to the reduction of plastic in our oceans. Sock My Feet is therefore proud to be an Eco Angel of the Plastic Soup Foundation. We support them with every online and offline purchase.

SORUKA,['Bags'],"BRAND: SORUKA DESCRIPTION: We are very proud to present our new collection of bags made in India with recycled leather. Our artisan bags are born from the reuse of leather scraps, useless stocks, leaky pieces or with imperfections from large factories.

The factories that produce leather goods generate a large amount of leftovers, scraps or waste of leather that are not used as raw material and generate environmental pollution due to the innumerable conditioning processes necessary to convert leather into a durable and resistant raw material.

Due to the lack of a recycling system, all this material ends up being garbage and this is where the need to process this raw material to make other products that serve society arises.

Our artisans rigorously select the structures and the varied colors giving life to a product designed for the modern woman with current fashion trends.

Each bag is unique and different, easy to combine with any look at any time of the year.

Souliers Martinez,"['Footwear', 'Bags']","BRAND: Souliers Martinez DESCRIPTION: The story of Julien Martinez and his brand are closely linked to his ancestry. Even while studying in France, Spain was always the place that sparked his creativity and the source of his inspiration. In 2013, while touring a workshop in the region of Alicante, Julien discovers a local technique of hand-braiding leather. This artisanal know-how will then become the foundation of his own brand: Souliers Martinez. After collaborating with various French fashion houses, in 2017 he turns his dream of branching out on his own into a reality. Working alongside Spanish artisans, he researches, experiments, and finally succeeds in seamlessly integrating their traditional workmanship into his creations.

Combining this with a rigorous selection of leathers, Julien imagines comfortable shoes with bold shapes. Each one is assembled and finished in Spain. The graphic lines are an hommage to the shoes his grandmother would wear, to the Spanish elegance and finesse she embodied. If the color palette reflects the richness of his beloved Mediterranean landscapes,
Julien’s “souliers” remain resolutely Parisian. Throughout the seasons, his assortment of woven leather styles has become ever more diverse, ranging from boots to pumps, asserting his style as a unique aesthetic.

STARTER,"['Menswear', 'Sportswear', 'Bags', 'Accessories']","BRAND: STARTER DESCRIPTION: STARTER is deeply rooted in American professional sport. The brand became known worldwide as the outfitter of the four big sports leagues NFL, NBA, NHL and MLB. In the 90s the sportswear developed into streetwear and thus shaped the style trend of an entire generation. This trend still continues today, which is why STARTER created the streetwear brand STARTER BLACK LABEL as an extension of the sportswear range. The brand playfully combines the cuts and colors of the core brand from the 90s with the iconic STARTER Classic Logo, creating stylish, sporty basics such as T-Shirts, Hoodies and Sweatpants. Sportswear such as Track Suits and Baseball Caps with intense coloring and colorblocking are also part of STARTER BLACK LABEL and therefore perfect for the ongoing 90's fashion hype. Due to the ever-increasing popularity of US sports the STARTER brand is more in demand than ever before.

Look for the Star.

Every year, State of Art develops eight clothing collections for men with an active lifestyle.

With sportive, contemporary and comfortable fashion, State of Art will be ‘a statement of style’ for many years to come. State of Art, a statement of style
Ever since 1936, the knitting workshop of the Westerman family had focused on baby clothing. In the mid-1980s the family company took the name Albert Westerman Group, and the main activity of the business changed. Increased competition, new materials such as terry cloth, and a lower birth rate meant a different direction was needed. Albert Westerman was able to tap into an upcoming market with the production of pullovers, among other things. As of 1987, these items were sold under three own brands, State of Art, Collumn and Tender(grass). When the company started producing less and distributing more, the decision was made to proceed with the strongest brand only: State of Art. It is not a coincidence that this is also the brand in which the late Albert Westerman's passion for classic cars is most keenly shown. The very first State of Art Store opened its doors in Almelo in 1994.

Stella McCartney,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Kidswear', 'Bodywear', 'Swimwear', 'Bags', 'Accessories', 'Jewelry']","BRAND: Stella McCartney DESCRIPTION: Stella McCartney was born in London to a family of creators who were legendary in public, but ordinary at home. Raised in both the city and the English countryside, she was kept grounded by her late mother and muse Linda – a photographer, vegetarian and animal rights activist whose values and innate appreciation for beauty continue to inspire her today. She graduated from Central St Martins in 1995, becoming immediately recognisable for her womenswear’s sharp tailoring, bold aesthetics and masculine energy. By 1997, she was appointed the Creative Director of Chloe in Paris and led the house to critical and commercial success.

In 2001, Stella McCartney launched her eponymous luxury fashion house and showed her first collection in Paris that October. A lifelong vegetarian, she has never used leather, feathers, skin or fur in any of her designs since day one – a revolutionary stance, then and now. Since those first seeds were planted, the brand has continued to grow its sustainability thought leadership through material and supply chain innovation, partnerships and more.

Subsequent key highlights for the brand include launching the STELLA fragrance in 2003, the ongoing adidas by Stella McCartney athletic-wear partnership in September 2004 and the first lingerie collection in 2008. In 2010, the iconic Falabella bag was introduced – distinguished by a braided chain detail the bag and now one of the fashion house’s best-selling items. Stella Kids was also launched that year and the sustainable fashion house additionally expanded into eco-friendly eyewear in 2011.

Stella was appointed Team Great Britain’s Creative Director for the 2012 London Summer Games by adidas – the first time in the history of the games that a leading fashion designer has designed the apparel for a country’s team across all Olympic competitions. In 2016, she launched the new POP fragrance and unveiled her first full swimwear collection. Additionally, Stella was invited to be the adidas Team GB Creative Director again for the Summer 2016 Olympic Games in Rio.

The first-ever namesake menswear collection launched in Spring 2017 and Stella designed the first-ever vegan Stan Smith in Fall 2018. That year, she also launched the Stella McCartney Cares Foundation – a non-profit charity platform supporting sustainability and breast cancer awareness, causes personally close to the designer’s heart.

After 17 years of partnership, Stella purchased Kering’s stake in her company in 2018. Later that year, she designed Meghan Markle’s wedding reception dress and partnered with the United Nations on a sustainable fashion charter.

In 2019, Stella McCartney entered into a partnership with LVMH to further develop her brand, while retaining majority ownership. She will also serve as a special advisor on sustainability to Bernard Arnault and the conglomerate’s executive committee. Stella additionally became the first fashion designer ever to appear on the cover American Vogue in January 2020.

Today, Stella McCartney spans women’s ready to wear, menswear, kids’ clothing, accessories, swimwear, lingerie, a performance wear collaboration with adidas, fragrances and more – with 55 freestanding stores across New York City, London, Los Angeles, Paris, Milan, Tokyo, Shanghai and Beijing. Our collections are now sold in 77 nations through 863 specialty shops and department stores, and ship to 100 countries via online.

Steve Madden,"['Footwear', 'Bags']","BRAND: Steve Madden DESCRIPTION: A man who wears many hats – and shoes, Steve Madden cannot be described in one word. He is an entrepreneur, an award-winning designer, a business titan, and a family man. The eponymous shoe designer is also the subject of the documentary film, MADDMAN: The Steve Madden Story on Netflix. A movie that delves into the man who built a booming brand and nearly lost it to “The Wolf of Wall Street,” only to rebound with a global empire. He’s endured failures and of course successes without forgetting his humble beginnings or his core consumer, resulting in millions of adoring fans worldwide. Considered the fashion footwear mogul of the 21st century, Madden has an innate sense of what’s hot, what’s next, what’s exciting and more importantly, how this will translate to the customer. Inspired by rock and roll, fused with a jolt of sex appeal and urban edge, Madden creates shoes that are innovative, fun, sometimes wild and always spot-on-chic. In 1990 with a mere $1,100 in the bank, Madden swiftly followed his intuition to create the next big trend, anticipate consumer needs and subsequently deliver collections that were both cutting edge and highly saleable. Channeling his creative energy to produce a variety of silhouettes and vibrant styles in his Queens-based factory, quickly his dream became reality and the Steve Madden brand was born.

The prolific designer’s expertise in trend forecasting has propelled him to the top of his field. Relying on sheer instinct, he transformed a footwear relic into a phenomenon when he introduced a new amped up platform shoe at the launch of his company. Inspired by rock stars of the 70s, Madden’s now famous chunky platform shoes were one of the biggest success stories of the time and became a hallmark to the brand. With his finger on the pulse of pop culture, Madden says, “What inspires me is what I see people wearing on the streets of the world from New York to London and beyond. I get my ideas and inspiration from pounding the pavement.”

There are no products matching the selection. The fusion of style and music remains at Madden’s core: “Music is in the DNA of what I do.” As with fashion and design, Madden has an eye and ear for emerging talent, which led to the creation of Steve Madden Music, an integrated marketing platform that promotes music artists through a multitude of media, consumer channels and live performances. As such, he has collaborated with stars including Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Ellie Goulding, Iggy Azalea, Santigold, Tove Lo, Jason Derulo, The Kills, Tori Kelly, Halsey, and Cardi B, all while on their rise to fame. With the continuing success and the consistent growth of the Steve Madden Music platform, Steve decided to expand on his love for music and launched 5Towns Records in 2016.

On a philanthropic note, Steve Madden is continuing to shine a light on those in need of a second chance by supporting a variety of organizations in that genre, while also helping to mentor young entrepreneurs around the country with the newly launched “Self Made” company initiative.

I would particularly like to promote this spirit and our values in Africa, as this continent is very close to my heart. Through numerous trips and visits on site, I have been able to get to know and love Africa with all its facets, but I have also seen how grateful we can be for our lives in Germany. For this reason, it is a matter close to my heart to open up new opportunities for women in Africa - opportunities for a better life. That's why I founded SOM empowerment.

This turned into six years of research and development to create the perfect shape, fit and most importantly comfort.  A pair of knickers that are the first you reach for everyday and made of the best fabric possible.  And a product that would be supportive of the environment.  The search led to a fabric that is made sustainably in Austria from Beechwood Trees called TENCEL™ Micro Modal. A fabric that is three times softer than cotton, wears better and is breathable with the skin. In 2017 Katie, together with good friend Nicola, launched Stripe & Stare, a business incorporating knickers and loungewear, all sourced consciously with a transparent product sourcing journey, that unites its wearers and creates a community where women empower each other.
We are passionate about our knickers. Our mission is to continue to make the best knickers in the world. This has now expanded to encompass a line of sustainable underwear, lounge and sleepwear - where your day begins and ends.

Studio EVA D.,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Studio EVA D. DESCRIPTION: About
Founded in 2005, Studio EVA D. was created by Dutch clothing designer Eva Dekker. Upon graduating from the art academy, she had a strong desire to launch her own brand, so she did without a clear plan. Eva began creating individual designs instead of conforming to the seasonal collection model, quickly realizing she didn't fit the traditional fashion system. Working alone and handling every aspect herself made producing two large collections per year impractical, leading her to adopt a rebellious approach that defied the conventional fashion agenda.

Initially focused on womenswear, she drew inspiration from menswear and discovered that her designs resonated with both men and women. This revelation sparked the inclusive nature of her brand, as her close friends expressed their enthusiasm for wearing her creations. Over the course of 15 years, her brand's strategy and DNA have evolved and matured, shaping its unique identity into what it is today. Studio EVA D. Values
Environmental Consciousness
Studio EVA D. values extending the lifespan of garments, sourcing natural textiles, and producing clothing in close proximity to the studio. The brand upholds responsible production practices, using natural, sustainable fabrics and designing small batches to reduce waste. Furthermore, each garment is created to be modular and timeless, enabling infinity combinations and long-lasting wearability. 
Inclusivity
The brand embraces wearability and understated elegance through our androgynous designs. We focus on functional details and neutral colors that integrate seamlessly with diverse wardrobes. Our designs adapt to the wearer, regardless of gender or size, fostering self-expression and inclusivity. 
Community
Studio EVA D. embodies Eva's design ethos and personal brand journey, where her community played a significant influence. As part of our community, we invite you to embrace clothing that goes beyond fleeting trends, allowing you to express your individuality and rebellious spirit.

Every jewel passes through our hands and contains at least one part of upcycled wood. We laser, paint and compose the pieces in our atelier in Mechelen (Belgium). We upcycle wooden parts of the sawmill from Joline's family. This way every jewel has its own unique wood grain drawing and adds to a sustainable forest management. To have a nice contrast with the wood, we add other materials like goldplated metals and resin. All earrings are anti-allergic and nickelfree. We mix and match colours and materials untill a new collection is born. 

Finally, we hope to make the world a little bit nicer with our jewelry, because life is too short to not wear beautiful earrings.

Styelle Swim Australia,"['Womenswear', 'Swimwear', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: Styelle Swim Australia DESCRIPTION: We are dedicated to bringing high quality, real Brazilian swimwear designed to move with your body, rather than against it.
Our goal is to make Styelle-ish women around the world to talk of the beach and nurture a sustainable future through our ethical sourcing and biodegradable materials. Styelle first started off with the perception of a bringing Australia an inexpensive but attractive swimwear company that was going to source its production from a small Thailand manufacturer – after seeing the waste, Charys, our founder decided it was not what she wanted for the people of the world. With a passion for the protection of our planet and a love of the beach, Charys sought out having the swimwear made elsewhere. Months of research were well worth it when coming across the beautiful suppliers of real Brazilian swimwear. Many people refer to our swimwear as “the best in the world” with its high quality double stitching and secure support cups. Our fabrics are printed both digitally and by hand (screen-printed).
Our primary fabric is Amni Soul-Eco (Fluity Co2) biodegradable fabric and we were the first brand to acquire it for Australia, introducing it in 2018.

So what does it mean to be ethical? A member of the Ethical Fashion Forum (now know as Common Objective) and taking on regular online training about ways to better the ethical side of her business, Charys is always looking to further her knowledge to bring only the best to you through Styelle. “When you wear your Styelle bikini or one piece, you know that you not only look and feel great – but you have made your contribution to the ethical and sustainable fashion movement. There are no children employed at our production houses – even the off-cuts of the materials are donated for art and crafts. The residues and recyclables are separated and collected by Votuporanga’s recycling company. ‘We are excited to allocate the residues without harming the environment” says Charys.

Sub_Urban Riot,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Kidswear']","BRAND: Sub_Urban Riot DESCRIPTION: The New Luxury

From the office - to the gym - to the road trip - we make clothes that reflect today's on the go looks... along with a splash of positivity and humor. Sub_Urban Riot was born in 2006 in Venice, California.

Two college friends realized that the cubicle life wasn’t for them so they quit their corporate day jobs. Following the rules that someone else made up no longer made sense.

Instead of settling for a good life, they decided to go against the grain to pursue a great one. So, at the beginning of the largest financial crisis ever, they risked everything to start a company. A company that would allow them to ignore the rules, have fun and not take themselves too seriously.

That spirit lives on today, as Sub_Urban Riot has grown into a global brand with a unique combination of positivity and humor; and a commitment to always re-imagine the good life.

Inspired by their love of travel, Pawel and Aleks designed and produced clothing for the store on the beautiful island of Bali, Indonesia.

SUICOKE,['Footwear'],"BRAND: SUICOKE DESCRIPTION: Established in 2006. 
SUICOKE is renowned for its unique approach to design, consistently challenging creative　development and utilizing only the highest quality materials. Having added Vibram® to the equation in spring 2014, it is no coincidence that SUICOKE is quickly becoming a household name. It was SUICOKE’s bold and active approach that helped the brand cement its place in the market, and with a desire to push boundaries even further, they found great unification with the likeminded Vibram®. In 2014, SUICOKE produced a sandal equipped with an original Vibram® sole – an industry first. What followed was a partnership built upon the pursuit of excellence, and after extensive research and development and much trial and error, the two brands went on to create one of the greatest products on the market – the Vibram® Morflex.

The Morflex sole completes the strong aesthetic of SUICOKE sandals, adding function and comfort. Its light-weight, shock absorbing qualities were the number one priority during development, and the result is a sole that enhances mobility as grip. In addition to the Morflex sole, a Vibram® VI-MF compound footbed is also used in SUICOKE sandals to ensure maximum resilience and cushioning.

With SUICOKE continuing to develop footwear that showcases the brands relevance within the fashion world, each collection is an indicator of just how much the brand is flourishing in an already competitive market.

SUITSUIT,"['Accessories', 'Bags']","BRAND: SUITSUIT DESCRIPTION: The suitcase market is changing. Suitcases are becoming more of a fashionable travel accessory, with contemporary colors, trendy designs and innovative materials increasingly becoming the standard. According to the founder and managing director of SUITSUIT, Emile Vijlbrief, women are the main driving force behind these changes.
“A few years ago I read an article in the Harvard Business Review, titled ’Women drive the future world economy’,” Emile explains. He cites from the article: “Directly or indirectly, women control over 25 billion dollars’ worth of consumptive expenditure worldwide, per year. Today, women represent a growth market that is larger than the markets of China and India combined. If you let such figures sink in, then it would be foolish to underestimate or even ignore the female consumer -- to put it mildly. And yet that’s still what’s happening in many markets, including the suitcase market”, says Vijlbrief. 

Vijlbrief continues: “The suitcase market is still a male-dominated market, as evidenced especially by the design and functionality of suitcases. For let’s be honest: most suitcases on the market are anonymous boxes on wheels. Once in a while you’ll see one in a trendy color or decorated with a half-inspired image, but overall they are dull and drab and with very standard functionalities. And consumers are tired of them, especially women. A woman looking for a suitcase is hardly interested in the commonly discussed aspects of material, weight or volume. Good to know, but not enough to tempt the female consumer. ‘Is the color or design in line with today’s fashions? Is the suitcase handy and easy to use? Will my clothes come out without wrinkles, are there enough zippers and pockets to neatly stow away all my personal stuff?’  Those are the questions she wants to see answered. ‘Is there a separate compartment for my high heels so that these won’t damage my dresses?’ And also, of course: ‘where do I pack my children’s wet swimsuits, after their very last dip in the pool?

So it’s time to design and develop suitcases from the female perspective. And that’s exactly what they do at SUITSUIT. Vijlbrief: “Our mission is to become the world’s number one brand for globetrotting fashionistas. This sets us apart from all other suppliers on the market. I dare say that SUITSUIT is the only brand that is passionately committed to developing suitcases, bags and other travel accessories that make a difference to how women travel, in terms of both design and functionality.”

The brand’s clear positioning and explicit focus are driving above-average growth figures, year after year. So the strategy is working. SUITSUIT products are now sold in 29 countries, through some 2500 sales outlets worldwide. In just a few months’ time the team grew to 23 people. Twelve at the head office in Soest, three at the branch in Germany, and eight at the branch in Hangzhou in China, responsible for the procurement, production and sales in Asia.

Super Normal People,['Accessories'],"BRAND: Super Normal People DESCRIPTION: The idea was there, but the money wasn’t

Hi! I’m Goda Narijauskaite, the creative mind behind Supernormal and this my story. Personally, as a designer I obviously wanted to fulfil my own part and create frames that were designed by me. But before creating my Supernormal dream, I had to earn enough money to budget this creative collection.
So, instead of doing a job I wouldn’t like, I decided to do a research through drop-shipping inexpensive plastic sunglasses and gaining the knowledge of the business. Starting right off with an independent collection would have bankrupted me financially and spiritually. I needed to gain the feedback from my clients to understand what people appreciate and look for when shopping for eyewear. Also, to understand how a frame fits and how it can be comfortable.

One summer day back in 2006 we found the shoes she wore in the basement of an old clog factory in the neighbouring village and brought them to stockholm.

So, for all the people that shared our love for anita’s wooden shoes, and for ourselves, we started to produce the same original styles, in the old factories with genuine materials, which ages in the most beautiful way.

We concentrate on what we do best: festive dresses for the important occasions and the special moments in life. After over 25 years of experience in the fashion industry, we know exactly what matters: that a woman feels happy in her dress.

Because fashion is our passion. And craftsmanship our basis.

Our branch and showroom is situated in the centre of the fashion location Düsseldorf. However, the heart of the production beats in Schermbeck: between the Lower Rhine, Münsterland and the Ruhr area, our experienced and creative team designs two collections per year with a true passion for detail. We create party dresses, re-interpret cocktail dresses and ball gowns to be new every time – and design smart day dresses which offer much more than just for 9 to 5. Our most popular dresses are never out of stock and available all year round and our label SWING Curve is dedicated to sizes 42 to 56. Magnificently styled. For every occasion.

With delicate lace and flowing materials we create dresses of casual elegance. We love wide swinging skirts and slim-cut shift dresses, we give timeless classics our urban twist and are just as inspired by both vintage one-offs as well as Avantgarde looks. Mini, midi or maxi, the showstopper or the clean understatement – our dresses are as diverse as the women who wear them.

We are proud to be able to contribute to women feeling a bit more beautiful. The sense of timeless design and genuine craftsmanship is present in everything we do. A back street in New Delhi. An avenue in New York. A walking bridge in Cambodia. We get the inspiration for our designs from a traveling life. It all began in 2006 on a visit to Shanghai, where we were overwhelmed by the city’s huge market for pearls and semi precious stones.

Back home in Stockholm, we made our first jewelry and put them on display. The response exceeded all our expectations, so we kept on making more. Today, Syster P jewelry and fashion accessories are available in several countries.

Travel destinations and pleasure still guide us. And we want you to feel the same happiness when you wear something from Syster P as we did when we created it. It’s personal. It’s Syster P. We are passionate about what we do and for solid craftsmanship where every detail is well taken care of. We always want to offer that little extra that makes you stand out in the crowd and feel special. Both through our personal design but also due to our editions always being limited. We appreciate our customers and pay close attention to being responsive, open and available. High quality is not only about our products and choice of materials, but also about how we meet our customers and the level of service we hold. We have an eye for detail and leave nothing to chance, it should always feel good to wear our products.

We are never really satisfied. We have a built-in endeavor to always try to outperform the expectations of each link throughout the chain. We are convinced that it is sometimes worth a detour. Consideration in both big and small. From design and product experience to service and delivery accuracy. You can always trust us.

TAKE A SHOT,['Accessories'],"BRAND: TAKE A SHOT DESCRIPTION: During their semester abroad in 2011, Matze and Hannes had the desire to create something of their own. When Matze came into contact with the first wooden sunglasses during his stay abroad, it was clear to us where the journey was heading. We weren't really satisfied with the clunky models of the time, so we started working directly on our own collection and only made the temples out of wood. That was new at that time. While Matze looks for partners for production in Asia, Hannes prepares the brand launch in Germany. After long discussions and many glasses of red wine, the brand name is quickly found: TAKE A SHOT. Because for us the translation means: ""Just do it. Dare!"" - and that was exactly our motivation when we founded our company. Today, we want to pass on exactly this spirit through our brand and encourage people to go new ways.

When the last savings are scraped together and the first delivery arrives in Germany, we are off: with the sunglasses in the boot and over 2000km more on the hump, we are richer by 12 shops selling our products after a weekend of spontaneous sales tours. Inspired by these first successes, we continue.

Tamga Designs,"['Womenswear', 'Accessories', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: Tamga Designs DESCRIPTION: TAMGA Designs is a sustainable lifestyle movement, born out of the need for a positive example in fashion.
We believe in a bright future for style, people and the planet, so we create clothing that respects all three. We started TAMGA in 2014 while living in Dhaka, Bangladesh, working for the UN and different NGOs with an ambition to change the world. My fiancé Eric and I arrived shortly after a garment factory collapsed, claiming over a thousand lives and leaving a pile of fashionable clothing brands amidst the rubble. The injustice, and our role in it as consumers of these brands, became painfully clear. We started asking questions, learning about the industry, and visiting factories. We followed paths that simultaneously broke our hearts and inspired us to take action.
Our journey building TAMGA has been far from a fairytale, but undoubtedly our biggest adventure yet. From days spent buying fabric in the chaotic textile markets of Dhaka, to months on the road building our own supply chain from scratch, we’ve been solely focused on one goal: proving that fashion can be a force for good.

Today we’re proud to be creating vibrant and premium quality clothing from the world’s best sustainable materials, with dignified conditions for every worker throughout the process. We're excited to continue our journey and share every step of it with you, our TAMGA tribe.

tara and i,['Womenswear'],"BRAND: tara and i DESCRIPTION: Our Story 

tara and i was established right after I experienced motherhood when I would constantly fantasise about events and occasions that I would enjoy with my daughter. An amalgamation of this beautiful experience led to the creation of aesthetics I envisioned; clothes I would like to wear and design in future for my adolescent daughter. 

The brand is a reflection of a never ending dialogue with my daughter about conscious choices that are bold, full of character yet exude composure in all aspects of life.

Profound interest in art and design resulted in creating luxe clothing for women that are meant to spark a strong emotion amongst all, it is meant to remind them not to take themselves for granted, it is meant to inspire a strong sense of self-care. JOIE DE VIVRE! The brand 

Exuding effortless chic, tara and i is a prêt-a-porter label for womenswear launched in Mumbai, India in 2018. We create elevated classics with a design vocabulary of casual chic and believe in bringing a chic romanticism & joie de vivre to life with our garments. 

The silhouettes celebrate natural proportions, with subtleties in form and fit, creating comfortable, flattering essentials for the modern wardrobe. Each garment is robustly constructed by hand with the finest materials with discreet details that create a look that is refined, confident and understated. The colours are bold, with character, exuding composure with a playful elegance. The result is contemporary, sharp, sophisticated classics that are versatile, transcend seasons and can be worn over the years.

The garments have an innate je ne sais quoi that make you feel good and can take you from desk to dining al fresco within seconds.

Tartine et Chocolat,"['Accessories', 'Bodywear', 'Footwear', 'Kidswear', 'Swimwear']","BRAND: Tartine et Chocolat DESCRIPTION: One brand, one history...
Because she wanted to wrap her babies in comfort and dress her children in softness, with elegant clothes that don't take themselves seriously, Catherine Painvin founded Tartine et Chocolat in 1977. The exclusive pattern ""Garda"", the Tartine et Chocolat stripes, sets the tone. Tartine et Chocolat offers children from 0-12 years a series of pastel shades. This has never or hardly ever been seen. It is a small revolution that has successfully turned children’s fashion upside down in France and abroad. In the wake of this, over time the brand has created its ranges, soft toys, perfume and nurseries and is now the leader in the market of top quality gifts for children.
Twenty-five years later, with a change of owner, a page has been turned so that the future can be better redrawn in a new impetus under the guidance of Emilie Zannier. As the guiding spirit of this renaissance, she is providing a unique and contemporary interpretation of Tartine et Chocolat. She has written our story with a new impetus, and is giving the brand a much needed timeless and original modernity. She knows how to produce new collections in a wonderfully tasteful manner...

Having launched as a shirt specialist of some repute in Glasgow Ted Baker quickly became the place to buy some of the very best contemporary men's shirting around.

From the beginning Ted has had a very clear, unswerving, focus on quality, attention to detail and a quirky sense of humour, so much so in fact that the first stores used to provide a laundry service for every shirt purchased – something that gained the quickly growing brand the title of ‘No Ordinary Designer Label’. Everything produced under the Ted Baker name has his personality woven into its very heart.

• Ted Baker is one of the fastest-growing leading lifestyle brands in the UK.
• The collections have expanded rapidly since its beginnings as a menswear brand in Glasgow in 1987.
• Today Ted Baker offers a wide range of collections including: Menswear, Womenswear, Global, Endurance, Pashion, Langley, Accessories, Fragrance, Skinwear, Footwear, Eyewear and Watches.
• Ted Baker has a portfolio of stores in the UK and USA and is also present in leading department stores.
• After signing three new territorial license agreements in 2006 and initially opening stores in Hong Kong, Singapore and Dubai we've continued our expansion in 2007 with the opening of a further store in Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok, three in Kuala Lumpur and two each in Dubai and Jakarta.

Ten Points,"['Footwear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Ten Points DESCRIPTION: The company behind Ten Points was founded in Norrtälje, outside of Stockholm in 1983. Our first ever collection carrying the Ten Points logo was launched two years later. It became somewhat of a success and shortly thereafter we decided to renamed our company after the shoes.Ever since that first collection we’ve focused on our very own version of Swedish style. Our vision was (and still is) very simple: to create quality shoes that make the wearer feel special. Those first years were marked by hard work finding the right manufacturers across Europe as well as finding dealers bold enough to back the new kid on the block. Once firmly established in the marketplace, Ten Points was given an even more refined fashion direction. We decided to step out of the mainstream and our design efforts became progressively sharper and more uniquely our own.
Today the Ten Points brand stands for quality shoes with modern, Swedish design and comfort. We’ve relocated our head offices to Ängelholm in the south of Sweden, but retain a showroom in Stockholm. Ten Points is now one of Scandinavia’s best selling shoe brands and can be found all over the world.
Every pair of shoes that wears our logo is designed and made by hand in Europe, using sustainable production methods and fair business practices.
- That’s why our shoes not only make you look great - 
They actually make you feel better as well.

Tenun Ikat Sikka,['Womenswear'],"BRAND: Tenun Ikat Sikka DESCRIPTION: Learned from the ancestors - woven for the future

The region of Sikka on the Indonesian island of Flores is known for its traditionally woven ikat textiles. The Sikka Weavers' Association is on trend with its culturally sustainable ikat textiles. They are part of the change in the fashion world, which is more and more moving towards sustainability and conscious consumption. The weavers from Sikka create unique fabrics whose motifs reflect a certain symbolism. They live in harmony with nature - the patterns and dyeing of the fabrics are characterised by motifs from the flora and fauna of their diverse island. They extract the dyes by hand from the plants and fruits locally and dye the threads in the tye-dye process. Black, for example, is obtained out of indigo leaves and red out of noni fruits.

This is how they revive the ancestral culture and tradition of their ancestors. The positive vibes and cultural touches is what makes each piece so special and unique. 

The product range not only includes a wide spectrum of fabrics, but also their own collection of accessories, consisting of pareos, silk scarves and foulards. The ikat textiles are also ideal for making individual garments or accessories. Since the fabrics are each hand-woven, each item is unique. In that way, individual customer wishes can be fulfilled.

For the creation of individual creations, a design kit and fabric samples are available. The kit and the fabric samples can be ordered in America, Europe and Emirates at hola@toqapu.com or in Asia at marketing@lokaleindonesia.com

Terror Kittens,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Kidswear']","BRAND: Terror Kittens DESCRIPTION: Terror Kittens is a young, high fashion streetwear label where haute couture meets sportswear. It was founded in 2016 in Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

A young Dutch designer, Annique Nahumury, decided to start a new brand in the city where she already studied, lived and worked: the harbour city of Rotterdam. 

Now, four years later, it has grown into a small local business. But the dream is, naturally, to take over the world. Style 
Inspired by eighties and nineties Japanese pop culture, retro gaming and prints, you see a lot of unique geometric shapes and prints back in the clothes. Even though black and grey are the predominant colours, Terror Kittens also combines a lot of bright (colour blocking) colours.
It still remains minimalistic in a way because of the simple shapes and trimming.
Perfect fit and good quality go hand in hand as “comfortable and sophisticated at the same time” is the credo. 

For who
Terror Kittens is a brand of inclusion. It’s for women, men and everything in between. Where the designs are mostly gender fluid, people can choose what to wear.
Footnote; as men and women differ in physique, common male/female measurements are still being used.   
Of course, Terror Kittens doesn’t discriminate in age (or anything else for that matter) but the main target group seems to be young urban professionals between the age of 18 and 48 (roughly) who choose for quality, sustainability and a fair way of producing fashion.

Terror Kittens vision
Terror Kittens thinks producing fashion should be sustainable and fair trade. By using environtment friendly and animal cruelty free resources and by producing these under the right working conditions, we are contributing to this important trend which should become the standard. Unfortunately this is not the case yet but Terror Kittens hopes to inspire others by doing this. 
These aspects have it’s price but are definitely worth paying for! As we love the world don’t we?
So Terror Kittens is a brand with a new, young, fresh vision of how unique fashion should be like and hopefully this could become a brand accessible for people all over the world, who would like to be a little different, or as you will, dare to be a Terror Kitten.

""My mother had a wool and fabric store in the 80s and a subscription to the Burda magazines, so I had the right environment to fully experiment with fabric and scissors. Already on my sixth I got my own sewing machine that I used to make doll clothes. I definitely have my own taste, but I guess my love for colors, prints, and their combination has already sprouted in my childhood, thanks to the costumes around me. ""

Exploring new routes, we constantly push boundaries. However, The GoodPeople are not some other rebel. We know the etiquette for good behaviour but sometimes we just like to break free from society’s expectations. Yes, we are the grown-up bon vivant who always remained our boyish outlook on life.  We like to play and are always up for a laugh. Always.

Inspired by life itself, The GoodPeople is a fashion label that celebrates both the joys and trials of being a man. This is reflected throughout the brand’s portfolio, combining refined quality with deliberate imperfection. From a strong line of fitted shirts, to hand finished knits and tailored blazers: the offbeat yet functional designs, vibrant detailing and contrasting schemes emphasise a man’s character. Conscious living at the forefront of all the brand’s activities, The GoodPeople continuously aim to push its boundaries. Just when you think you know what to expect, the collection spins another twist so surprising you can’t help but staying hungry for more. That is life according to The  GoodPeople.

The signature cloud logo, as featured on the garments, represents this ultimate state of liberty.

Founded in 2007, this Dutch label offers a complete range of men-only, modern authentic wardrobe essentials. Crafted in Europe only from the finest materials.

The selection of cuts, materials and colors is obvious. The cardigan can be worn as a classic jacket that replaces the blazer in the office. It gives the everyday look of jeans and T-shirt a chic touch. As a fine cardigan, it complements evening wear and when it is thicker, the cardigan even replaces a coat or jacket on cooler days .

In contrast to cardigans, cardigans are usually made of finer materials such as merino , new wool, silk and cashmere . Wholesale

In 2019, the founder and his team of designers in Serbia decided to start developing the brand for those who want something completely unique, powerful, high quality and luxurious.
 
Our idea is to create something that will help people define themselves, make them feel comfortable in their own skin and yet look stylish.

Nowadays fashion is not just a piece of clothing but an important part of personality, lifestyle, and success. Who is Mr.Crossbow?

The face that hides behind Mr.Crossbow is a face that resembles all of us. Mr.Crossbow transfers through his brand many traits that are common in empowerment with both males and females.
 
If you see yourself as a bold, strong and adventurous person or you seem to lack some of those traits, then in both cases Mr.Crossbow is there to support that. Mr.Crossbow does not just stand as a brand who uses a bow and an arrow in symbolizing their brand, they actually stand behind empowering and making people feel empowered and confident when they wear it.

The North Face,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: The North Face DESCRIPTION: Founded by husband and wife Douglas and Susie Tompkins in 1966, acquired by Kenneth Klopp two years later and ultimately taken over by the VF Corporation in 2000, The North Face has specialized in technical mountaineering equipment and apparel including sleeping bags, hiking packs, tents, skiwear and high-performance outerwear, as well as performance apparel, footwear and equipment for explorers, climbers and endurance runners (among others). By the late 1990s, the notoriety of The North Face’s attire meant that its customer pool expanded beyond those merely looking for technical clothing and entered the lives of rappers and various other subcultural stylings; for instance, the North Face’s Tech Steep jacket featured in Wu-Tang’s Method Man music video in 1993.

That withstanding, the fashion and music scene remains only a small part of the company’s business, with it focusing more intently on creating advancements within outerwear and equipment for serious hikers and climbers.

These pants had the power to make women feel confident, smart, and stylish. Never before had American sportswear been so easy to wear to work and everywhere else.

The Quartermaster,['Menswear'],"BRAND: The Quartermaster DESCRIPTION: The Quartermaster is a project of two friends who have known each other for over ten years. In 2017 we began to join our paths thinking and producing garments that could tell our passion for vintage, especially military and workwear, and for quality clothing. From the beginning our goal has been to produce a collection strongly inspired by the war productions of the past and the iconic garments of the great industry of the last century. We are fortunate to be able to draw on our archive which boasts more than 1000 items including jackets, shirts, trousers and vests. To be able to build our perfect wardrobe over time, we started a long journey through our incredible country with passion and dedication. Ours is a continuous research of historical textile factories that for decades have invested in quality and tradition and of laboratories specialized in quality packaging. For winter garments we use local fabrics because our city, Prato, can still boast a splendid active district with many companies that still produce regenerated wool, characterized by high resistance and peculiar technical characteristics. For the summer garments, however, we fell in love with the magnificent cottons and indestructible Lombard fabrics that can be found in the now rare companies located for more than two centuries along the Olona river. We also use fabrics from abroad, such as Scottish oilcloths or Japanese shirt cottons, only when companies guarantee high quality standards.

Ours is a small family-run artisan company and this is the dimension we want to defend and preserve. We escape without compromise the rules of the fashion system that we now consider immoral, unjust and harmful. We are increasingly moving towards a proposal of 100% Made in Tuscany garments, presented right now with an ad hoc label. This allows us to authentically tell the place where we live and work and to create products with a very low impact on our planet.

Whoever buys a The Quartermaster garment, be it a jacket, a shirt or a sweatshirt, is aware of choosing an object that lasts over time and does not follow the trend of the seasons.

We are happy with what we do, proud of where we come from and jealous of all the people we work with.

Think!,"['Footwear', 'Bags', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Think! DESCRIPTION: Located between the Danube, Alps and foggy valleys, the Sauwald, the “roof of the Innviertel” has a long tradition of craftsmanship. This is also the case in Kopfing im Innkreis, where Martin Koller, son of a 200 year old shoemaking dynasty, did not want to accept the fact that “healthy shoes look so terribly ugly”. And so he did everything differently. When shoemaker Andreas Koller settled in the Karl-Fritzn house in Ruholding in 1860, he became the founder of a shoe dynasty: his son, a trained orthopaedic shoemaker, turned the shoemaker’s workshop into a steadily growing shoe factory specializing in men’s shoes and in 1975, production expanded into the shoe wholesale market. Great-great-grandson Martin Koller jun., quoted above, subsequently had the idea in 1990 to expand the family’s men’s shoes business with the brand Think! and focus on ecological, healthy shoes with aesthetic appeal. The new direction took off; the shoes became bestsellers and today, Think! Schuhwerk GmbH exports worldwide.

Think! has been ambitious in terms of sustainable shoe manufacturing from the very beginning. We have been living sustainability, environmental awareness and been paying attention to using the best materials for almost 30 years now. We can only welcome the fact that the world is moving towards conscious consumption with open arms.

From our own experience, we know that people with a mind of their own go their own way. Sometimes straight ahead, sometimes round the corner, sometimes quickly and sometimes slowly. We want to accompany all these unique people with experience and know how. Our shoes have personality. They are just as distinctive as the people who wear them. For us, individuality, self-confidence and the opportunity to express yourself freely are fundamental.

Our shoes are dedicated to all those who go through life with joy and have the courage to be themselves.

Thought,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Thought DESCRIPTION: Thought hasn’t appeared overnight. It’s taken many a rolled up sleeve, late nights, and steely determination. Our love for natural and sustainable fabrics is where everything began. The first styles we made were simple. We were eager to show the beauty of these kinder yarns so didn’t overcomplicate our designs.

We discovered the yarns really came into their own when carefully cut and sewn as the simplest of tunic dresses, a classic shirt. More designs that let this raw beauty come through are what happened next.

Today, there’s still a simplicity in silhouette that we haven’t lost. It’s what brings an air of timelessness and wearability to our pieces.

thylie,"['Womenswear', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: thylie DESCRIPTION: Love at first touch

The Thylie shirt is more than just a nice shirt. Due to the variety of sleeve lengths in the respective neckline shapes, the collection not only impresses with a strong competence in models and colors, but also in the combination of double front parts and the use of the finest Peruvian PIMA cotton quality with a small amount of elastane, the shirt guarantees a unique one Wearing comfort.
The cuts and qualities were designed precisely to meet the needs of women. The doubled shirts do not show and flatter every figure. The Thylie line emerged from the great demand for an extensive, high-quality basic shirt line for every woman. Thylie - a shirt to fall in love with! The high-quality women's shirt line was created and developed by Ms. Monika Hess, a very experienced product woman in the womenswear segment. With the Thylie brand, Jürg Brändli enters a new market segment with his company Ragman, which has been writing a steady success story since 1980 and is now one of the leading suppliers of knitted and hosiery in Europe.

TIAN,"['Jewelry', 'Accessories']","BRAND: TIAN DESCRIPTION: „We used to be cool as well“ is the beginning of an exciting journey. In old photo albums I discovered pictures of my father, wearing a colourful watch. Upon asking whether he still had this watch, he already had it in his hands, telling me about its distinctiveness, for compared to other watches this one does not feature classical watch hands. The brand Chromachron was founded by Tian Harlan back in the 70s. Time could only be roughly estimated, due to the fact that the brand did not use a minute or second hand. The aim was to revolutionise time, while taking off the pressure. Because of the limited number of watches there are hardly any originals left.

My fascination with the idea of not showing time accurately to the second or even to the minute promoted the idea of a reinterpretation, which is why this brand is named TIAN.

The vision behind TIAN remains unchanged: Slow down your everyday life.

Nowadays we are constantly confronted with time and the classical wristwatch with its function as a time emitter lost its significance. Hence, with its new design approach TIAN sets an example for time.

Each full colour equals one full hour, every line 15 minutes.

The search for our own babies had been limited and expensive, shipping the few pairs we discovered from all over the world. We wanted to try and do it ourselves.

It took ten months to launch our first designs and there wasn’t a blue tractor in sight. Instead, we created a playful world of foxes and bears for our boys, Tobias Fox and Arlo Bear, the namesakes and inspirations behind the brand.

Here he opened a shop in Prenzlauer Berg with an adjoining workshop. Every piece of jewelry is lovingly handcrafted there to this day. Even a sale of the TOSH label in 2009 did not change anything in terms of the team and location, but it did lead to a realignment of the TomShot brand towards significantly more delicate pieces of jewelry.

Uwe Schröder's spirit of discovery showed itself early: in 1967 he went on a 35-hour flight to Hong Kong in order to open a new production facility there on his own - long before such an adventure was common in the industry. He paves the way for himself and ultimately establishes his first factory in Vietnam ... which was destroyed again in 1969 during the Vietnam War.

Toni Sailer,"['Sportswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Toni Sailer DESCRIPTION: The Austrian, Toni Sailer, was an exceptional talent of his time after he won three gold medals in the 1956 Olympic Winter Games in Cortina d’Ampezzo. The 21-year-old had achieved all his athletic goals and had become a legend. In addition to athletic success, he also earned this title through his other passions - acting and singing. 50 years later in 2004, the Toni Sailer name is reinterpreted with a business idea from Hans Taubenberger. A distinctive premium brand for ski clothing is created that not only reinvigorates the name. For our designers, every new collection is a challenge! Highly functional attributes, the foundation of premium ski clothing, must be translated into a fashionable, sophisticated form. Developing a collection can take us up to two years - from research on design and cut development to production, monitoring, and delivery. The phase in which we develop new functional materials and colors for the Toni Sailer brand is very time-intensive and exciting.
 
We use exclusively the highest quality materials to stay true to our philosophy and to constantly impress. A fine difference can be felt in our garments, for quality is always durable, stable, and unfading. All Toni Sailer pieces profit from perfect, ergonomic tailoring, impeccable processing, and exclusive details. Thanks to craftsmanship and complex technical processes, a new collection emerges every season ensuring a pleasurable long-lasting fit and a look that attracts everyone’s attention

Too Hot To Hide,"['Womenswear', 'Bodywear']","BRAND: Too Hot To Hide DESCRIPTION: It's great that you found us! If you don't know us yet: We are Too Hot To Hide and we make legwear. In German: tights and socks that you don't have to hide. But please show it!
Why are we doing this? Because we no longer just wanted to buy the same brand that mom and grandma have always worn. And because we don't like compromises. No ladder - of course. But also nothing that slips, becomes apparent or pinches. And of course nothing scratchy. So, together with two great family businesses in Northern Italy, we initially developed the tights of our dreams: All of them come without annoying dividing seams and unattractive gussets. They all feel great, are super comfortable and go perfectly with your favorite items. Too hot to hide.
Speaking of fitting: Because clothing sizes have little to do with leg lengths, many women wear the wrong size. Too Hot To Hide ends the chaos and is based on body length: those who are shorter than 1.70 meters wear one size, everyone else the other - super easy. And always suitable up to size 42. 
After the tights - we call them hidies - we decided to go for socks. We didn't want to create the seven thousand four hundred and thirteenth colorful cotton sock, but rather pretty, feminine and mega-fashionable pieces.

These socks are very fine, light as a feather in delicate 20 denier or made of thin, shimmering viscose qualities. The mini-hidies fit in spring and summer and enrich every city style: sometimes transparent, sometimes with sporty and cool cuffs (athleisure, darling!), Sometimes with flashy lurex elements, sometimes with brightly colored dots.
Just like the tights, we also have the socks made by our legwear professionals from Mantua and Brescia. We visit them quite often to fine-tune new designs, to discuss innovative materials, to improve the quality that little bit more. Before and after we eat the most delicious pasta with them, drink way too much espresso and way too little vino (because we're always there by car?).
Because there is a lot of heart and soul in all hidies and mini-hidies, we love them all. So much so that we name them. From people we think are particularly great. Because they support us a lot - whether as a designer, model, stocking manufacturer or friend.
Now there is only one thing missing to be very lucky: that you love her too. The main thing is that you feel good with our socks and tights. No the best. That's what it's all about.

Topaz Boutique Swim,"['Swimwear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Topaz Boutique Swim DESCRIPTION: Topaz Luxe Ltd is a bespoke brand that sells self designer premium swimwear. The theory behind the brand name is that Topaz closely resembles the finest aquamarines, blues, turquoises, neutrals and gorgeous blush tones. The most abundant colour of Topaz is blue and green. Which reflects the cool of the ocean translated into one colour palette. The stone is traditionally known for love and good fortune and bringing a successful attainment of goals. 

The company’s founder, Miss Natasha Rose Griggs is an experienced swimwear designer herself. She found that the current swimwear market is missing the niche of classic sexy swimwear with luxury quality at a competitive price.The magic of the brand is in the detail. What sets Topaz aside from other swimwear brands is the attention to the detail and construction of each piece of swimwear. Each item will consist of luxury fabrics, shiny branded hardware, reusable recycled protection bags, and personal attention to detail. Each style is an exclusive design to the brand, which is independently designed by Topaz Swim.

The company’s mission is to create exclusive premium swimwear which promotes exclusive designs to a tailored fit. With feminine cuts that accentuate the female physique. Elegant simplicity defines Boutique Designer Swimwear, revealing flattering shapes which are expertly crafted and timelessly chic.

We are currently stocked in three Luxury Sanderson Retailers across the UK, and making progress to launch small pop up stands within the niche Resort and Cruise Line Industry. Including meetings with Harding retail to stock Topaz Swim on Virgin Voyages and The Ritz Carlton Collective, I am also in talks with The Five Palm Dubai.

Since Topaz Swim launched in 2020, we have been awarded Best New Swimwear Brand of the Year by Central Prestige Awards 2021, and have been recently nominated by the Women’s Business Awards for Business Women of the Year. OUR BRAND ETHOS:

Our Journey to Sustainability 

PREMIUM QUALITY THAT LASTS
With conscious consumerism at the core of our company values, our mission is to create premium swimsuits that you will look and feel your absolute best in. We work closely with our manufacturing team to ensure that each bikini is delicately hand made to ensure a unique standard of sophistication, longevity and optimum quality. Our suits are designed to be worn comfortably and proudly for an eternity of summers. With TOPAZ SWIM you are investing in quality suits that last!

COMPOSTABLE PACKAGING
In our efforts to be a more sustainable brand, we are taking steps to ensure that our packaging is recyclable, reusable or compostable! The packaging is the ultimate physical representation of the brand's belief system. Topaz will demonstrate its commitment to sustainability by using 100% biodegradable packing material. Not only is Topaz contributing to the environment, but the packaging is given another life after purchase. Allowing the customer to take the bags to the beach and use them for makeup, accessories or their swimsuits. All our products are shipped in 100% biodegradable shipping bags.

MINIMISING WASTE
Not only do we take waste management seriously at our HQ, but we also work closely with our supply chain to minimise as much waste as possible. Off-cuts or leftover fabric is minimised through smart production techniques however when off-cuts do remain, our manufacturers aim to repurpose them towards the creation of hair scrunchies.

WE DONATE
As a brand we want to support the environment and help protect our oceans, this is why we have teamed up with Work for Good to donate a percentage of sales to Marine Conservation Society.  MCS is one of the UK’s leading Marine Wildlife Charity who clean oceans and protect marine life. We are so proud to be able to support this charity and hope we can contribute a lot more in the future.

TOS gallery,['Accessories'],"BRAND: TOS gallery DESCRIPTION: “I’m inspired by the weird, the different ones in the crowd, the beautiful strange. The ones that are a bit off, the sophisticated freaks, the ones pushing the boundaries of ‘normal’ and proving the known ideas wrong”. People that still like stories, dreaming of mystery, who aren’t afraid of being openminded to unusual subjects are the future of beauty. These people float elegantly around in their own mindset and authenticity, inspiring others and bringing refreshing ideas to the surface. TOS gallery designs are produced per story, not per season which is where the philosophy came to life: “STORIES, NOT SEASONS’. Quality goes over quantity; personal attention for pieces are touched by the hands of the maker is a very important element in the design process of the brand. Beautiful things simply deserve time and attention. The philosophy combines the three main focus points of the brand: craftsmanship, art and imagination.

The beauty in being a little weird, also seen as being authentic, is a big inspiration to the designer. Stories in mythology as well as inspiring personalities are the source for enchanting artworks, hand painted silk scarves and magical materials. “We want to point out our own perspective on ‘beauty’, to not stick to what the established idea of beauty represents. Beauty is found in being your truest self, not in what the world wants to see in you.”

Traffic People,['Womenswear'],"BRAND: Traffic People DESCRIPTION: Traffic People was born in the heart of London on the Portobello Road and Camden in 2002, looking to bring a contemporary twist for the woman who desires a timeless design with the right amount of naughtiness to reflect her unique inner style. Traffic People was devised out of a love for vintage inspired fashion and beautifully dressed women of eras past; Lauren Bacall, Anita Pallenburg, Ava Gardiner and Bianca Jagger to name a few. The Traffic People design ethos is to encompass the latest fashion trends in a contemporary style with a vintage, edgy feel with the use of beautiful and unique print and details. Originally influenced by the styles that pervaded the 20s and 30s, Traffic People have supplemented these styles bringing in timeless designs as the 50s wiggle dress and giving a nod to the fun stylings of the 70s disco glamour era.
 
Our small in-house design team works to create contemporary, edgy and creative styling with the Traffic People Girl at the heart of everything we produce.  Cleverly cut pieces in fabulously unique quality fabrics with delectable detailing and prints, ensures our range has unique exclusivity to the brand that sets us apart from other independent labels. Traffic People doesn't mass produce our styles, sometimes only making 50 of each style within our production team, meaning Traffic People Girl knows she can wear a design unique to her and a handful of others.

Traffic People began to supply selective range of independent boutique stores throughout Britain and a network of carefully selected wholesalers and distributers supplying shops throughout Europe. Today Traffic People can be found in hundreds of stores around the world, as well as some of the world’s most desired online fashion websites such as Zalando, Silk Fred, Harvey Nichols and Lux-Fix.

Trashious,"['Bags', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: Trashious DESCRIPTION: OUR TRASH. YOUR TREASURE. 
Our story starts with a waste bin. Literally. Not the best start for a high-end fashion label you might think. On the contrary! We are all aware that the global waste mountain has become a huge problem. We can no longer ignore it. Literally! We are therefore convinced that it is time to join the ever-growing zero-waste movement.

WE PROMISE YOU WASTE. GREEN WASTE. 
With our infinite love for beautiful bags and accessories, and because we want to stop further pollution of our earth, we have started a search for a sustainable, animal-friendly and circular alternative to the current animal and synthetic leather. And we found 'green' waste for this. CRUELTY FREE, NON PLASTIC LEATHERS.

WINE IS ALWAYS THE ANSWER
For us it sounded unreal. But if it was true, oh how much we wanted it! Who could ever have thought of wine leather? Well, someone in Italy did. Leather made of leftovers from wine production. Wine leather is soft, smooth, stable, 100% sustainable, almost feels like leather, and it can even be recycled!

AN APPLE A DAY
Yes correct. It does keep the doctor away. So let's eat lots of them! Because what you might not know, apples are not only good for your health, they also contribute to a better planet. Can you imagine? From the cores and skins discarded from the industrial food industry, apple leather is made! A sustainable alternative for animal and plastic leather. We know... madness.

CACTUSLEATHER; A SHARP IDEA
Even overseas we found ‘green trash’. 2 Mexican guys are transforming the leafs of the Nopal cactus into leather. Nopal is used for the treatment of diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity and hangovers, but also as a food. The leafs of this plant have always been thrown away, but now they are used to make cactus leather.

SHINE LIKE A PINEAPPLE
Muy impressionado. That is what we were when we read about this beautiful material made of a by-product from the pineapple fruitindustry; pineapple leaves. Once the long fibres are removed from the leaves ( these create the beautiful texture) the leftover biomassis used as a natural fertilizer. Two waste product, two uses. With this, this leather alternative litteraly takes the crown in turning trash into treasures.

DESIGNED BY REBECCA CABAU
We are very proud to mention that Rebecca Cabau van Kasbergen has designed our bucketbag. We know her as a person who cares deeply about animals and the world. 
 
FREE A GIRL
A part of the proceeds of the bucketbag will go to the foundation of her choice: FREE A GIRL, founded by her sister Yolanthe Cabau van Kasbergen. Free a girl strives for a world without sexual exploitation of children. A goal that Trashious also fully supports.

A Belgian creation

Established in Binche since 2001, our communication agency decided in 2019 to give free rein to the project of its creators. Thus was born IMPERIAL STYLE OF TREBIUS VALENS, a young and colorful casual menswear collection declined in T-shirts, pull-overs and socks.

Inspired by Napoli

Originally from Binche in Belgium, but also from Naples, the creators of TREBIUS VALENS are inspired by the cultural fusion born of intra-European migrations a graphic style where we sometimes find the clear line of Belgian comics, sometimes the colours and exuberance of the Parthenopean city. With European values

Beyond the streetwear brand, TREBIUS VALENS wants to promote values specific to European diversity. Social and environmental respect is at the heart of our company’s development policy

To be imperial, is to be committed to social, economic and environmental respect.

So IMPERIAL STYLE OF TREBIUS VALENS wants to

- participate in a new business model. We respect the entire manufacturing and distribution chain by ensuring each stakeholder a correct profit margin without making the final consumer pay,
- reduce our ecological impact by favouring European producers. Our creations are entrusted to Belgian, Italian and French artisans. We reduce the use of cartons and plastics by avoiding unnecessary packaging,
- participate in local development by promoting local employment.

Sustainability and local savoir-faire are his main concerns. The brand's chic and relaxed style is summed up in this cozy oversized coat, the brand's signature. It is an enveloping piece giving allure and comfort to any outfit. With the line of “vintage remade”, the label pushes the work of reuse even further. After being selected for their warmth and colorful shine, vintage wool blankets become cosy coats made of patchwork cuts. This summer, the vintage silk scarves become oversize shirt dresses and super cute caracos! All Tremblepierre pieces are made locally in France (Paris) in order to maintain proximity with the manufacturers and reduce the environmental impact.

The unique pieces are handcrafted in the brand's Parisian atelier. The label wants to offer luxurious garments at true prices. By avoiding intermediaries, Tremblepierre wishes to offer to its customers an excellent level of quality at an affordable price.

It’s the petty vices that make a man interesting, and it’s the ‘not pretending to be someone else’ that makes a man irresistible. TRESANTI believes there’s a bit of a sinner in every man and there’s nothing wrong with that. In fact, it makes the world a more interesting place. TRESANTI encourages men to stay true to their nature in being just a little vain, a little hot-tempered and a natural tempter. Let nobody tell you you shouldn’t. Goody-two-shoes can go to hell, as far as TRESANTI is concerned. That’s why they put a little bit of sin in every piece of clothing. For the real man that embraces his own small vices, because he knows they are what sets him apart from all the others. To know them, to cherish them, even to express them. Wholesale

The contents of our wallets have changed a lot over the past few years. Many types of “plastic money” have been added to the classic means of payment. In addition to credit and EC cards, we now always carry various customer cards, payback cards, membership cards, etc. with us. Our personal data is stored on all of these cards.

On the one hand it is very easy to be solvent anytime and anywhere, on the other hand the security risk is increasing. Sensitive personal data can easily be read illegally, whether when paying or on the go, without being noticed. TRU VIRTU philosophy

Our TRU VIRTU® products therefore focus on the security and protection of personal data and documents.

The TRU VIRTU® product philosophy stands for the development of innovative and functional products with a protective function in connection with an unmistakable design and high quality. TRU VIRTU® products offer individuality and a unique product experience.

High-quality materials such as anodized aluminum, high-strength plastic and stainless steel are used. These make TRU VIRTU® products extremely resistant and light at the same time. This enables new product properties and applications such as RFID protection to be implemented.

All TRU VIRTU® products are developed and tested by our engineers and designers exclusively in Germany.

Much attention has been given to the representation of his collection, depicted by famous photographers Ellen Von Unwerth, Paolo Roversi, Peter Lindbergh, Steven Meisel and fashion star Karl Lagerfeld among the others. The front man though reserved attitude of Ugo Cacciatori gives him the opportunity of being the best spokesman for his projects, with respect and attention of all the fashion system. He has been the one reacting to post-minimalism and neo-gothic attitudes in fashion, expressing a new aesthetic possibility of romanticism in contemporary times. Referencing eccentric and intellectual style of life, his designs reflect a sophisticated construction of shapes combined with a wide comprehension of textures, surface finishing and gems. The result is a truly Made in Italy craftsmanship, an honest expression of contents and forms giving life to a collection whose syntax is closer to a novel than to the established fashion timing.

Umoja Shoes,"['Footwear', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: Umoja Shoes DESCRIPTION: Founded in 2018, Umòja, which means ""unity"" in Swahili, is a sneaker
brand that combines tradition, modernity and innovation while valuing West African textile craftsmanship in respect of its environment. MMEA, THE FIRST SNEAKERS 100% PLANT BASED.

MMEA [méa], meaning 'plant' in Swahili, is a 100% plant-based,transparent and fully traceable sneaker.
In 2019, the Umòja team launched its first collection. Upon its release, it became aware of the ubiquity of plastic in footwear design.
This makes it difficult to recycle shoes, and at the end of their life,shoes are thrown away or incinerated. The team chose not to launch a new collection, prioritising research and development to find plant-based
alternatives to produce a plastic-free shoe. MMEA is the result of these two years of development.
It is a shoe designed without plastic. Produced from four noble materials sourced from Burkina Faso, France and Portugal: cotton, linen,hemp and rubber milk. It is a sneaker whose end-of-life materials are valued and controlled.
Thus, MMEA is a story of connection between the textile know-how of sub-Saharan Africa and European innovation.

PRODUCE AND CONSUME DIFFERENTLY.

Our sneakers are designed in an artisanal way, 100% plant-based, from
the dye to the glue and the sewing threads. The team works directly with
farmers and craftsmen in a fair trade approach.
We insist on total traceability of the production chain, which is not the case for all brands in the footwear sector. MMEA is proof that we
can create a virtuous, authentic, sensible product by playing by different rules than those dictated by the industry.
It is the testimony of our team members, our partner producers, artisans
and farmers, our consumers and contributors that we can collaborate on a
semi industrial scale and offer a noble, healthy and beautiful product.
It conveys the idea of a change, of a dynamic that we wish to take as far as possible, in the most beautiful way.

A WORD FROM THE FOUNDERS

""Umòja, which means ""unity"" in Swahili, is a brand of sneakers that
combines tradition, modernity and innovation while promoting West
African textile craftsmanship with respect for the environment. We are
convinced that artisanal know-how should be promoted in the context of
changes in our consumption patterns. Our convictions lead us to believe
that international trade can be organised around human and ecological
values, without losing product quality. For this reason, we experiment
on a daily basis, in order to get closer and closer to our ideal
lifestyle. As the production of our sneakers is dependent on the
artisanal production of the textile of which they are made, we can only
produce a reasonable quantity. And that is our goal! To offer you
unique, transparent sneakers, rich in history and
expertise.""

UNBORN,"['Menswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: UNBORN DESCRIPTION: Our planet, our only resource, our opportunities for today.

Every day we use natural resources to sustain our lives and how we use these resources is a question of ethics. The pursuit of brand value and the ever faster quest for newness has created an industry that is producing volumes of clothing without putting focus on how we treat the people and the planet in the process.

An ethic that is impacting our planet, shifting our attention away from the solution and the things that matter most in life. Through UNBORN we want to fix the design flaw of the clothing industry. Eliminate waste and create a better world for future generations. We envision a world of perfect harmony between nature and product, of life in balance.


We don’t value the ever faster quest for newness or the creation of products without commitment to life and planet. We believe in products that are made for usage, not consumption. Products that can become a resource for the products and plants of tomorrow. We believe that if we own less we can experience more.

We embrace No Waste, Slow Paced, Pure Products. 
We embrace the truth. 
We embrace respect for all life.

Untouched Underwear,['Bodywear'],"BRAND: Untouched Underwear DESCRIPTION: Distinctive prints are and will always be fashion statements in today's fashion scene. 
In 2017, we, three young Dutch entrepreneurs, took the plunge and started developing, resulting in the launch of the brand Sock My Feet in 2018. 
But what is a distinctive and sustainable sock without matching distinctive and sustainable underwear ?! Our answer is ""Untouched Underwear""!
Our collections are shaped by three core values: 
""Distinctive prints"", ""Sustainability"" and ""Quality & Comfort"". Distinctive prints
We provide our underwear and socks with prints with a classy and rebellious ""tone of voice"" for every ""mood"" and ""mindset"". Our prints are recognisable, stylish and at times provocative.

Sustainability
The fashion industry has a bad name when it comes to sustainability. This is because the sector is the second largest water user in the world! 
Untouched changed the game in the spirit of 'one small sustainable boxer for you, one giant leap for our planet'.
We want to show that clothes can be produced in a responsible way for people and nature, in contrast to 'fast fashion'. Dyeing and treating textiles in today's textile industry is responsible for about twenty percent of the world's polluted water. By printing, we save 90% of water consumption compared to the traditional colouring of yarns.

Quality & Comfort
For Untouched Underwear we have carefully chosen Modal. After years of development, we have now succeeded in producing high-quality prints on modal. Modal’s distinguishing characteristics are its high-wet strength and extra softness.
It is sometimes referred to “as soft as a feather” and “the softest fiber in the world.” In addition to its use in general apparel, its softness makes it especially ideal for body contact clothing such as lingerie and undergarments.
Modal is a natural synthetic fiber and is made out of cellulose from beech wood. It is 50% more hygroscopic than cotton. Beech wood is extracted in sustainably managed forests. This comes with several advantaged.
The beech trees can easily grow and almost everything can be used from this tree. 

In short: Fits comfortably, feels comfortably and looks comfortably: that’s Untouched Underwear!

URBAN MEDLEY,"['Accessories', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: URBAN MEDLEY DESCRIPTION: Urban Medley was ideated to promote centuries old forms of weaving and printing that are inherently sustainable and without support would be lost forever.  The old world printing and weaving is used in our accessories which balance tradition with contemporary design. 

Urban Medley is not about mass productions and machine-made perfection, it is all handcrafted, so there is room for minute imperfections and minor blemishes which then translates to the uniqueness of the final product and therefore no two will be an exact copy. We are not bound by age, race,  colour and not even size, hence we choose sustainable, handmade ethically produced accessories, as our main focus point. We give you the space to create your own style using the many fashion items we bring to you on this platform.

Our focus is on scarves, wraps and capes. Accessories which are not size specific, multifunctional and can be used across seasons. Accessories which cater to a wide global audience and can easily complement any outfit. 
Bold colours and nature inspired designs. Each piece carefully crafted by our artisans is colorful, boundless, energetic and involves a lot of experimentation.

Our range of silk scarves and capes are made of organic Eri silk commonly known as peace or cruelty free silk. The cotton wraps are made with organic rain fed Kala cotton.

The wide range of scarves and capes are ideal for the modern woman who believes in her individuality and is mindful about what she wears. She does not simply follow a trend but believes in making a statement and an impact on the environment – Her every action reflects a conscious mind. 

Our products qualify as heirloom pieces and definitely supports the philosophy of ‘buy better and buy less’.

We believe today more than ever before it is important for an ethical brand to convey the values it stands for. To build a brand and create an awareness around it, one needs to connect with consumers at a deeper level.  Urban Medley is extremely conscious about the impacts it makes- working with artisans we are enabling a community to earn a dignified living doing what they are best at. It also brings about overall economic development within rural communities. Our production processes are ethical and maximum possible sustainable.

Uzurii Luxury Footwear,"['Footwear', 'Bags', 'Jewelry']","BRAND: Uzurii Luxury Footwear DESCRIPTION: BRAZILIAN DREAM BECOMES REALITY

Shieglee Ferreira dos Santos would have never believed that all her dreams would actually come true. Until she was five years old, Shieglee was raised in the Amazon rain forest. She then moved with her mother, sister and grandma to the slums of Rio de Janeiro. Shieglee: ‘Because clothing and footwear were handed down from one child to another, I decorated them with everything I could find on the street just to make them a bit nicer.’’
When she was 13 years old and moved with her mother to the Netherlands. Determined and ambitious, she obtained her high school diploma in the pre-university track and raced through various fashion courses. Years later,  she met her husband and started to build her life with him.  Until 9 years ago, when Shieglee and her husband were strolling through the market in Rio de Janeiro and she started to relate the stories of her youth. Her dreams became more alive than ever! “In the market I came across a woman behind a stand selling flip flops that she decorated herself. I stood there glued to the ground and saw my entire childhood on that table. It was as if I was seeing myself as a child, plucked from the jungle, sitting with a needle and thread making my worn-out flip flops nicer.” That evening she began writing her business plan for designing flip flops in the Netherlands. The next day Uzurri was Born! In 2011, Uzurii Luxury Footwear was officially launched and made its way into the world of high fashion. All the designs were made by hand and demanded a special technique. For more than a year, Shieglee flew all over the world to train more than 100 women. These women do not work in a studio, but from home. That way, they can work in their own environment and also take care of their children. Each pair of Uzurii that we receive is pure craftsmanship.” Nowadays, the luxury footwear is sold in the higher segment of shoes and fashion stores in more than 1,400 stores spread over 46 countries. Every year the collection is expanded with a higher segment of Uzuriis and a wider collection of bags.

Mario Valentino,"['Accessories', 'Bags', 'Footwear']","BRAND: Mario Valentino DESCRIPTION: Naples, Italy 1952. Mario Valentino opens his studio and ever since the headquarters of the company that has become a world leader in the manufacture of leather goods and by now an historic producer of shoes, accessories and haute couture. The story has it's origins at the beginnings of the last century, under the reign of King Umberto II of Savoy; Mario's father Vincenzo was already famous in and around Naples and even further afield under the label “ Valentino”.

The choicest hides, expert workmanship and absolute care and attention to details could not go unnoticed neither to the royals of the House of Savoy nor to local aristocrats or international celebrities.

A griffe of extreme elegance and quality which taken under the young but genial wing of Mario Valentino, Vincenzo's son and his entrepreneurial dream and with a workshop at his disposition is finally realised; freedom to create original designs and to be in the avantgard. Now daring, bright pink high heels vertiginous stilettoes made super femminine by the ingenious use of colour, cut and coupage.

At that time a mere twenty pairs of shoes a day were despatched from the atelier; almost “made to measure”, one-off pieces practically unique in their kind, for example the mythical flat sandal, light-years away from the bon ton of the times but a startling revelation of future taste.

It was that distant 1954, that a simple flat sandal with the barest decoration; a coral flower and two fine threads of coral beads, a minute but precious “must”, more than footwear; a mirror of the the times that has conquered and made history.

First seen during Rome's Alta Moda fashion week, this simple sandal charmed and enchanted everyone from the public to buyers and the press. It is still displayed in the Bally Museum at Schonenwerd, Switzerland next to the shoes worn by Queen Elizabeth II on her wedding day.

The value of this footwear earned a first editorial in French Vogue and paved the way for the contract with the I. Miller New York studio; the only company in the Americas that at that time imported and distribuited luxury shoes and leathergoods to the United States.

Mario Valentino a great patron of arts himself and with his own personal, deep and passionate conception of art and sartorial elegance as unison, inspired his creativity and was also compatible with his favourite artists such as Andy Warhol, Gio' Pomodoro, Robert Rauschenberg, American painter and graphic artist whose early works anticipated the Pop Art movement and all of whom also shared and appreciated his same ideas.

His Neapolitan heart remained firm and in his small work place in the district of Sanità in Naples one can still breathe in the essence of that good taste and elegance, typical of the culture of the City of Partenope.

In 1966 Mario returns to Naples from America and concentrates his creativity to bags and accessories for the evening the daytime and sometimes a bit sporty too, however never renouncing precious calf, kid, sheepskin etc.etc. and also splendid colours, patchwork and original patterns.

Since the Seventies, collaboration with designers of the calibre of Karl Lagerfeld, Giorgio Armani, Gianni Versace e Claude Montanà, the imprint Mario Valentino extends to clothing that one might only describe as trendy or avantgard.

Leather jackets, trench-coats, skirts and dresses, this is where the brand defines it's distinctive superiority.

In these years the greatest top models of their time were called to bear witness and contribute to the success of the fashion house; Veruska, Pat Cleveland to name but just two, combined with the memorable publicity campaigns of the photographic genii of Robert Mapplethorpe, Richard Avedon, Tyen, Oliviero Toscani and Helmut Newton, they united Mario Valentino's philosophy about art and design in a single “address”.

As ever, ready and eager for new experiences, in March 1979, Mario Valentino participates at the first Milan fashion week and brings to the catwalk his own collection.

Thanks to the tradition of craftsmanship and technological innovation, the hides skins and leathers seem always more like fabric for their lightness, softness, versatility and comfort; all of course all entrusted to the able and specialised Italian team of professionals.

Amongst some of our clients we may note Farah Diba, Empress to the Peacock Throne and wife of the Shah of Persia, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, First Lady of the United States, Consuelo Crespi, Italian countess and influential fashion editor for Vogue, Maria Callas, diva of opera, Elizabeth Taylor Oscar winner, Catherine Deneuve and Catherine Spaak famous French actresses, The Kessler Twins international singers of cabaret in the Sixties, the Italian actresses Monica Vitti, Michelangelo Antonioni's Muse, Ilaria Occhini, Laura Efrikian and Stefania Sandrelli, many titled winner of the David di Donatello Award, the Italian singer Ornella Vanoni, and not forgetting the superb men's shoes preferred by Marcello Mastroianni, Fellini's icon actor of “La dolce vita” and “Fellini 8 e 1/2”.

In the Eighties the “Maison” expands throughout Europe, North America, Japan and a general leadership in Asia due also to the opening of exclusive boutiques Mario Valentino. By now recognised as leader in the sector not only by the industry but by figures of relevance such as Ronald and Nancy Reagan, Italian Presidents and the U.S. Ambassador to Italy Rabb.

Quality is never improvised or made in series; research of materials design and manufacture are the essential secret and without having to renounce one's own personal style and prestige.

The signature continues under the convinced direction of Mario's son Enzo Valentino. Representative boutiques and showrooms may be found in the most elegant streets of Naples and Milan's pulsing heart of Brera.

After developing a foot problem while she was growing up, she always needs to choose her footwear with certain set criteria in mind. Faced with a very limited choice once she’d made comfort her absolute priority, Vanessa was already sketching out her future vocation, without even realizing it. A burgeoning creative streak blossomed while at Lanvin, where Vanessa started out as an assistant product manager, finding out about every angle of an industry that she was passionate about, and learning to master many different aspects. She later went back home to be with her family, who were skilled in shoe sales. It was meant to be a temporary move, but proved to be a revelation.

Motivated by strong values which have helped to enrich her career, she went on to make these principles central to her identity: firstly, a desire to help women, which has driven her to imagine innovative solutions, with technology and craftsmanship at the service of women’s well-being, but, also, a self-confidence that boosts her customers, giving them the key to live their everyday heroine lives, while in their stylish boots or sneakers, of course.

Vargu,"['Bags', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: Vargu DESCRIPTION: The story took its course when Reinhard Margelisch was hit by a car and was reluctantly immobilized for eight months. His time passed by slowly. The studied political scientist and investment broker, who partly financed his studies with the production and sale of his sculptures, used the time for self-reflection. He critically examined the meaning of his current professional activity. His conclusion called for meaningful and creative action that included sustainability, social engagement, an environmentally sound product, and economically sustainable growth.

A trip to India in 2007 laid the foundation for his future work. Terrified by the sight of the mountains of garbage and social injustice, he was persuaded to act. Unexpectedly, his travel plans were thwarted by the idea of ​recycling ​waste and its transformation into a product.

Now one thing led to another.

Reinhard stumbled upon a silk sewing atelier, which he could take over due to a low order situation, set it up and expand it. It took a lot of time and patience to explain to the Indians the meaning of waste recycling. Initially, he had to open up all the channels from the collection of waste, their cleaning and the delivery itself.

Working in Delhi meant for him to adapt quickly to new circumstances and situations, to engage in a foreign culture, to overcome language barriers, to endure 40 degrees of heat and to be in constant motion during the monsoon season.

With courage, risk-taking and the determination he founded his first label VARGU.

VARGU stands for variations & arguments.

In 2019 VARGU presents a new design with technical innovations (the new VARGU face).

The choice was made to change the production location to China, due to the availability of advanced raw materials. At the same time, the generation of gray energy can be contained.

At Verhulst we are stubborn: our shoes have to look as beautiful as they are comfortable. Or, the other way around, they have to feel as nice as they are beautiful. Therefore, we select the best, most flexible types of leather with the finest structure. Because flexibility is one of the main conditions for an excellent fit. The fine structure is not just beautiful but also very ‘cuddly’. Feel for yourself! Subsequently Verhulst chooses with each shoe design the technique that provides the best fit. The various shoe lasts in diverse widths that are used for reshaping, ensure that any foot will feel comfortable in a Verhulst shoe.

The real secret of the quality of Verhulst is on the inside of the shoe. The patented flexible innersole for example, provides extra wear comfort. The stiffeners (the ‘heels’ of the shoes), that we strengthen double at Verhulst, provide optimum support in combination with the elongated steel cambreurs (length stabiliser under the foot arch). So the quality on the inside is just as important for an excellent wear comfort as that of the outside!

VGTL,"['Footwear', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: VGTL DESCRIPTION: VGTL  (reads VEGETAL )  is the story of two young French people who want to make things happen and who give themselves the means to achieve their ambitions, without making any compromises. We decided to create an eco-responsible brand with streetwear-oriented collections because we wear them every day and we want to keep them for a long time. A look inspired by the street, timeless and intergenerational, at the antipodes of fast fashion.

You will find a wide variety of items with us. At no time have we chosen the easy way. Due to the number of colors available, the choice of cuts, and materials, the requirement is the central point that connects all of what you can find at VGTL. Because still considering animals as exploitable resources makes no ecological and ethical sense, all of our creations are vegan.

Go further, do not scare us, let's talk a little technical for those who are interested: Our textile supplier:

The company was created with the conviction that the textile industry must act in a much more responsible way. From the raw material to the finished product, not forgetting transport and marketing, we act responsibly.
We are committed to being responsible for our environmental and social impact throughout our production chain, starting with the raw material that only uses organic cotton, recycled polyester or plant fibers (wood textile) whose production requires as few natural resources as possible and no polluting products (pesticides or solvents).

Using organic cotton, we are drastically reducing our water consumption. We promote crop rotations and biodiversity. As we do not use GMOs, our cotton is softer and you can feel it immediately in contact with your skin. The other types of fabrics that we use also allow us to preserve nature or contribute to the recycling of plastic waste.

FASHION REVOLUTION FACT # 1:  The majority of our production is woven and assembled in Bangladesh, but in addition to independent checks by the FAIRWEAR FOUNDATION , we ask each production plant to commit to a working code, which is more demanding. than that defined by the ILO (International Labor Organization). 

All production containing cotton is GOTS certified . The Global Organic Textile Standard is the result of a collaboration between the main players in the field of standardization with the aim of defining requirements recognized worldwide and thus making it possible to guarantee the organic quality of textiles since the harvest of raw materials, through socially and environmentally responsible manufacturing, to labeling to provide a reliable guarantee to the consumer.  

The FAIR WEAR FOUNDATION is a non-commercial association to which brands, distributors and clothing producers can join to engage in a verified and transparent process of improving working conditions in the clothing units of their supply chains.

Viking Footwear,['Footwear'],"BRAND: Viking Footwear DESCRIPTION: 1920s
Vikings history starts January 17th, 1920 when our founding father Peter Mathias Røwde founded a rubber factory in Askim. The brand name was Viking and the factory started to produce galoshes to prevent shoes from getting muddy and wet. Ever since then we have worked after our mission “To enable an active outdoor lifestyle”.

Early on Viking brought in rubber chemists that contributed to making our products superior to our competitors. Because of changes in fashion, the production of galoshes was reduced towards the end of the 1920s while the production of snow socks and gymnastic shoes increased. Gradually Viking expanded the production and started making rubber boots, work boots, leather shoes, hunting shoes and soccer cleats. 2010s
During this time, Viking continued to be innovative. The hunting boots with GORE-TEX was improving even more and kindergartens and schoolyards were filled with kids wearing our shoes. Viking was, and still is a trusted brand when parents bought durable shoes for the different seasons for their kids.

VIONIC,['Footwear'],"BRAND: VIONIC DESCRIPTION: VIONIC's mission began with the work of renowned podiatrist Phillip Vasyli. A pioneer and innovator in the field of lower-limb biomechanics, Vasyli treated thousands of patients, ranging from young children to amateur and professional athletes. Known by friends and colleagues as a ""born healer"", he had a genuine passion for making orthotic treatment more affordable and accessible to people in need of pain relief. Early in his career, Vasyli realised that the only treatment options for many common foot-related ailments, like plantar fasciitis or over-pronation, were costly and time-consuming. In response to the overwhelming demand for a solution, he invented one of the first heat-mouldable orthotics, a low-cost option that allowed patients to walk out of his practice feeling better than when they'd come in. This philosophy laid the groundwork for the award-winning FMT Technology orthotic, the world's first and only true orthotic available without a doctor's prescription.

Vasyli's creation revolutionised the industry and paved the way for limitless innovation in the footwear field, laying the groundwork for VIONIC's stylish range of shoes, sandals, boots and orthotics.

Having spent our first years working with mixed materials such as wood and ceramic, we have now turned our attention to designing primarily with stainless steel. 

The reasons for using this metal are countless. It does not rust, tarnish or turn your skin green. But more importantly, steel is the most recycled material on the planet. With a lifespan of up to three decades, 86% of steel will be reused.

Each Vitaly piece may therefore contain remnants of skyscrapers, bridges or car parts — a cycle that continually influences our experimental design process.

Vitamin A,"['Swimwear', 'Accessories', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: Vitamin A DESCRIPTION: Founded in 2000 by California native Amahlia Stevens, Vitamin A combines feminine design with sustainable innovation. Vitamin A bikinis and bodysuits are designed and made locally in California, in their signature plant - based and recycled fabrics. Amahlia is inspired by ‘70s California beach style; she's all about simple shapes, a flawless fit, and a sunny natural sexiness that is in her DNA. Vitamin A is a member of 1% for the Planet, and gives back a portion of proceeds to environmental organizations who work to protect our oceans. Sustainability Bio
At Vitamin A, we believe that style and substance can coexist. Designer and Founder Amahlia Stevens grew up hiking, snowboarding and swimming in Southern California, with a love of nature in her DNA. Before launching the brand in 2000, she worked on a design project with Yvon Chouinard, the founder of Patagonia and a pioneer in the Environmental movement. During that time, she learned how Yvon was redefining the outdoor industry by creating technical fabrics from recycled plastic bottles, and she decided to create something similar for swimwear.

However, when Amahlia began to research the options, she was told by fabric suppliers that there was “no market” for swimwear made from recycled fibers - so she decided to design it herself. For 3 years Amahlia worked with the top mills in Italy, Canada, and California before finally perfecting the process and introducing EcoLux, the first premium swim fabric made from recycled nylon that combines sustainability and technology, to fit like a sexy, second skin. Today, her vision is quickly becoming industry standard.

Other ways we reduce our environmental footprint are by employing waterless digital printing technology and incorporating other sustainable materials into our beachwear like Linen, organic cotton, recycled cotton, Tencel®, and polyester fiber made from recycled plastic bottles (full circle, right?). We produce our fabric and our swimwear locally, which dramatically reduces our emissions for shipping and transporting raw materials. We take the time to get to know the people who make our goods, and we are proud knowing that our manufacturing team maintains a high standard of ethics and environmental responsibility. Vitamin A also partners with and donates a percentage of sales towards environmental organizations that protect and preserve clean water - so we can all live, work and swim happy and healthy.

About Amahlia
Vitamin A Designer and Founder Amahlia Stevens grew up on the beaches of Southern California, living in a bikini for as long as she can remember. She got her degree in Illustration from Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, and designed for top brands around the world before launching Vitamin A in 2000, combining her passion for the ocean with modern design and sustainable innovation to pioneer the perfect bikini: simple, clean, sophisticated and sexy.

The first to elevate swimwear with neutral color palettes and chic day-to-night pieces, Amahlia understands a woman’s body, and fit is always the most important element in her designs. After all, she is the originator of the ultra flattering LBB - Little Black Bikini, as well as the now iconic “California cut”.

And if that wasn’t enough, all of her suits are made sustainably and locally, to keep you and the earth looking sexy. Basically who better to design your dream bikini? She just gets it.

Amahlia lives in Laguna Beach with her husband Julius, and twin girls, Gemma and Ruby.

Vlieger & Vandam,"['Bags', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Vlieger & Vandam DESCRIPTION: The story behind new generation luxury label VLIEGER & VANDAM is a story about interdisciplinary design, about the relation between art and fashion, and about innovative craftsmanship. 

Carolien Vlieger and Hein van Dam, trained as graphic designer and industrial designer, respectively, started the VLIEGER & VANDAM label in 2004 in response to the overwhelming success of their collaboration in 2002. This collaboration named ‘The Guardian Angel Handbag’ was a comment from both designers on all the media attention to street violence in the city of Rotterdam, the place where they had just settled. 

Those early Guardian Angels were assembled with parts from second hand handbags and new brightly coloured felt embossed with a distinct profile of a large kitchen knife or handgun. A handbag turned out to be the perfect vehicle for an international widely felt and far from salon fähig sentiment. In 2005 the Guardian Angel Handbags were featured in the exhibition SAFE: Design Takes on Risk at MoMA in New York, where they have been part of the collection ever since. Fashion statement or functional objet d’art, the Guardian Angel Handbags – by now translated into a vast number of styles for men and women and made in the most luxurious leather qualities in stead of felt – are a genuine design classic. They have been spotted on the arms of stars like Rihanna and Rita Ora as well as architects and fellow designers such as Zaha Hadid and Fabio Novembre, and they are featured in numerous exhibitions and design collections.  

Over the past decade the VLIEGER & VANDAM collections have seen many more bestsellers such as the Handcuffs clutch and hand painted Splash accessories. The label distinguishes itself with outspoken interdisciplinary design and innovative embossing techniques using the most luxurious leather qualities by Italian and Spanish tanneries. All bags and accessories are made in specialised leather workshops in Europe. New generation luxury means a traditional high end quality and craftsmanship, but with statement design as an added value in stead of conventional luxury industry branding.

The brand was founded in 2014 and by now has grown into a project, united around itself a whole community of brave and young-spirited people from different subcultures and fields of activity, giving them space for creative expression and interaction.

The main sources of inspiration for the brand are art, cultural and social phenomena. Each collection carries a number of ideas, united by a common concept — thus the VOLCHOK team broadcasts its own vision of what is happening around.

VOLCHOK collaborates with Russian and Ukrainian artists, musicians, photographers, models, often giving them the opportunity to try themselves in something they have never done before.

To oppose freedom of fantasy to stereotypes, courage to hypocrisy - these ideas have determined the development vector of the project.

Heroes of the brand do not want to vegetate in the backyard, they do not expect a more successful moment to start living — they want to be creatively realized here and now, without losing their personal freedom and identity.

Instead of cultivating the horrors of modern Russia, VOLCHOK appeals to heroes who are creating a new history and a new culture.

One glance at your watch will inspire a sense of ​Alpine culture, nature, freedom and leisure!

As a family business, we take pride in our home, embodying modern interpretations of Alpine tradition, and practise careful use of natural resources. Hence why we deliberately choose locally sourced Alpine wood, the highest quality merino wool, original Sölker marble and genuine leather for the crafting of our pieces. With our regional suppliers and manufacturers, we ensure that each Waidzeit item tells its own story while guaranteeing the highest quality along with an Alpine influence. Inspired by the Alpine zest for life, we are constantly expanding our sophisticated Waidzeit range. For example, we use wood from oak barrels in which wine and whisky once matured.

This creative upcycling gives our watches, jewellery and glasses from the wine, whiskey and beer-barrel line a unique and adventurous connoisseur story, one which we tell with passion. In our brand-new gin line, we go one step further and use, for the first time, the finest juniper wood for the dial. Gin can hardly be represented more authentically! Individuality and pleasure, mindfulness and connection to nature - that is what we at Waidzeit stand for.

WALD Berlin was founded by the stylist and model duo Dana Roski and Joyce Binneboese around 2012. It originally started as a bricks and mortar concept store in Berlin Mitte. After taking a creative break, the two founders decided to re-launch the boutique as an online-only store, stocking a selection of curated lifestyle brands. The switch from bricks & mortar to online allowed them to travel the world and be inspired to launch their very own brand in 2018 - WALD Berlin. What drives us / Our ambition

While the inspiration behind WALD’s design stems from all over the world, from the founders’ experiences and travels abroad, the company still has its roots in Germany and is proud to be a fair-trade and family-oriented business, supporting women, mothers and grandmothers all over Germany. With this collective of women, WALD tries to empower and give back to some of the most important members of society, who often enough struggle to resume their career after being a full-time mum and are likely to be overlooked unfairly. Every single piece - in some point of its manufacturing process - goes through the hands of one of the women working at our collective.

WALLIEN,['Swimwear'],"BRAND: WALLIEN DESCRIPTION: WALLIEN presents a brand new wave of female empowerment in swimwear. Collection SS21 suits all women OUT THERE

Amsterdam – Sustainable water fashion brand WALLIEN launches its new SS21 collection OUT THERE. Eco-friendly, revealing your beloved curves but also hiding the places you prefer not to show. “I want to help women feel beautiful and confident in their skin. And it was about time for swimwear that makes us feel that way – strong, gorgeous and sexy – and lets us move around in comfort. That’s what I call empowerment”, says WALLIEN founder and designer Madeleine Wallien. The new collection will be OUT THERE from 22 April 2021. WALLIEN’s SS21 collection is for all women OUT THERE. Feminine and strong. Sexy and functional. Made for all body types. “It’s our most powerful collection so far”, thinks Madeleine. “Designed to empower women to feel confident, beautiful and sexy. For themselves.” 
With this insight, WALLIEN offers a brand new wave in swimwear and watersports garments. 

Celebrating all women and all body types
This designer and watersports fanatic created a collection that feels nice and comfortable to wear. “But comfort doesn’t mean compromising on style. 
I always aim to make it fashionable. With this collection we add great sustainable options because it’s made of recycled fabrics. By popular demand
I made tops for a larger and smaller cup size and bikini bottoms for wider and smaller hips. Available in beautiful neutrals and in colour. To celebrate all women, and all body types. I want all women to feel wonderful and strong in our sustainable swimwear.” 

Female future
WALLIEN wants to contribute to a more female future, without stereotypical thinking. “Women feel exposed to all kinds of stereotypes when they reveal their bodies in swimwear or sportswear. At WALLIEN we feel that women have to get out of the labeling, out of the old ways of thinking, out to sea to catch that wave, out to feel free to swim in whatever they want, out to challenge themselves, and out to let the world know that they are beautiful just the way they are.”

Strong and beautiful
“Women do not want to be perceived as sexy or smart, or as lazy or non-sporty when they have a bigger size. We want women to feel empowered in our watersports garments and feel feminine and sexy at the same time. We design for the modern women who dream of a world where they can be their strong and beautiful selves in whatever they want to wear. We are ready to take ourselves OUT THERE.”

During this process we hope to bring more awareness to hemp as an option for clothing, especially underwear. As we were studying hemp textiles we learned that hemp fabric has many benefits like being naturally anti-bacterial, super soft and breathable. We quickly realized that the best application for hemp fabric would be hemp underwear and that’s how WAMA was born.
We started from scratch creating our unique hemp fabric. We had a rigorous and super long design process because we wouldn’t accept anything less than perfect. For most this would be their first experience with hemp underwear so we obsessed on every detail from the stitches, pattern pieces, colors and overall design. We want everyone’s first experience with hemp underwear to be nothing short of amazing!

From the very beginning, Warmbat uses only 100% Merino sheep wool in its boots, slippers and slippers. Due to the temperature-regulating properties, Merino sheep wool is suitable for both summer and winter. Today Warmbat stands for the timeless slipper; warm, cool and above all comfortable.

WAUW CAPOW,"['Womenswear', 'Kidswear', 'Swimwear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: WAUW CAPOW DESCRIPTION: We, Louise and Mia, met each other at ‘The Danish Design School’.

We quickly discovered we shared a common dream:
to create children’s clothes inspired by the playful spirit of children. In 2008 the dream came true.  We proudly (and with butterflies in our stomachs) presented our brand BangBang Copenhagen. We believe children are free to wear whatever they want, and a lot of our clothes are therefore not gender-specific.

We tailor-make our prototypes to ensure the design fits children’s shape and movements. This makes our clothes comfortable to play in. When children play, they get messy – and children have to play! To resist the hard job of being worn by playing children all day,  our clothes are made of high-quality textiles.
Children are open-minded, curious, playful and wonderfully creative.
As parents, we, Mia and Louise, observe and enjoy this approach to life every day and we owe a lot of our best ideas to our children.
Each style and every little detail are designed and made by us. Our designs are inspired by modern and conceptional arts and colors, different animal shapes and textures and the comfortable and functional elements of streetwear.

WAWWA,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Bags', 'Accessories']","BRAND: WAWWA DESCRIPTION: Clothing that puts people and the planet before profits.

Manchester-based  WAWWA Clothing is a sustainable brand making organic, fairtrade, vegan, planet-friendly clothing with a positive social impact.

WAWWA offers a wide range of casual and wearable styles and accessories that work on the model of onebought, one donated, as part of their 1+1 collection. Designed with durability in mind, WAWWA utilises sustainable materials to create functional garments that minimise their impact on both the environment and those that inhabit it. WAWWA has recently expanded their in-house production in their independent Manchester-based factory. The factory was set up when the pandemic hit due to the need for face masks and reduced demand for PPE. Their in-house production now covers the majority of the accessories on offer, as well as new jersey and woven styles.

The Manchester factory will be the lifeblood of the brands' sustainable approach, enabling ultimate control over how the pieces are produced, creating a truly transparent supply chain. The factory also enables  WAWWA to train local people, paying them above the living wage and stemming the migration of talented designers, cutters and sewists out of Manchester, a city draped in textile heritage.

Weird Fish,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Bodywear', 'Accessories', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: Weird Fish DESCRIPTION: OUR JOURNEY
The story begins in 1993. After a bracing and inspiring walk along a coast path in Cornwall, Weird Fish was born with a simple mission: to produce well priced, well made and distinctive clothes that become instant feel-good favourites. Over 25 years later we are proud to still have the same founding values at our core, as this is what makes us Weird Fish. THE WEIRD FISH SHOAL
This is who it’s all about.
The Weird Fish shoal choose us because we offer something different from the norm. A sense of fun, an eye for practicality and plenty of style and quality.
Don’t be surprised if you bump into them on a hike across the moors, out walking the dog, flinging a frisbee with the kids on the beach, or just having a chat down the local. They do things the Weird Fish way!

WHAT YOU CAN RELY ON
We pride ourselves on the provenance and quality of our clothing, and work closely with our trusted suppliers to ensure our factories adhere to our strict rules, such as no child labour, and excellent working conditions.
We are always looking for cleaner and greener processes. For more information read our ethical policy.

WEAR THE WEEKEND
We live for that Friday feeling. Whether we're unwinding by the coast, walking our dogs, or just catching up with friends at the local, the weekend gives us the time to unwind and be ourselves. We believe everyday should be full of the freedom and fun that the weekend gives us.
This belief is lovingly stitched into every Weird Fish product. Everyone has an old, trusty favourite in their wardrobe. You know the one we’re talking about; the well-loved jeans or ‘washed 100 times’ T-Shirt that puts you in a good mood the moment you put it on. When Saturday morning rolls around and it’s time to escape the daily grind we just want to kick back in our feel-good favourites and enjoy the good times. Every piece of our clothing starts with that feeling in mind because we deserve this sort of comfort every day.

Welden,['Bags'],"BRAND: Welden DESCRIPTION: After two decades working with leading luxury brands, I’d watched the fashion industry shift. Fast fashion became more important, while the craftsmanship of a bag—what I valued most—was lost to automation of machines. This drove a passion in me to create designs that were recognizably made by hand, unique, modern, and would exude quality in every detail. Leaving the corporate world behind, with two small boys and a supportive husband at home, Welden was born in 2015. Partnering with a passionate group of women, we continue to drive a brand that stands out, always being creative in our approach, and learning each day. Each season the collection is a new journey with a DNA to call our own.

Welcome to the world of Welden.

WEMOTO,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Bags', 'Accessories']","BRAND: WEMOTO DESCRIPTION: Wemoto is a creative collective, founded in 2003 by Stefan Golz and Patrick Lotz as a company of friends with the same interests and mind sets. Coming from skate, music and street culture, our mental influence was and always will be the understanding and interaction between people. We set out to be a lifestyle brand that mixes subcultures combined with fashionable designs to create products that serve the global youth culture. Since the beginning, Wemoto never followed the path of usual practices of the fashion industry. We always had our own pace and rhythm and are launching our ideas twice a year plus some pop up projects we love to release from time to time.  

We only produce what has been ordered by our customers and cover our own needs with the necessary quantity. This way we avoid unnecessary overproduction which does not find any takers at the end of a season. Our collections also have always built on one another and, even if they come from different seasons, can be combined very well.

When it comes to our products we’re connecting with people globally and are getting close to them by visiting their own space and lives. To build a long term relationship with our suppliers is one of the most important parts of our sustainable value chain. We’re working with a small group of partners, which are the size of small family businesses, for more than a decade now. We know each other very well and we continuously visit each other on a regular basis to discuss our cooperation as an ongoing transparent relationship. We want to take the chance to develop, progress and grow with our partners, to get them into a sustainable production state. Together with them our goal is to turn Wemoto into a fully sustainable brand within the next few years.

At Wemoto, sustainability is also high quality products that can stand the test of time, that is worth to be repaired and end up in a recycle loop system. We want to create garments with a socially and environmentally friendly footprint. 

While we are creating “conventional products”, we also aim to use sustainable materials. We care about where and how we produce. We try to use materials that are recycled and the final product can be recycled as well.

At this time 75% of our garments are made from OCS certified organic cotton yarns or from recycled fabrics like polyester or nylon. In collaboration with our suppliers we take the responsibility to provide a safe, fair and ethical working environment for all the people who are involved in the manufacturing of our clothes.

Our production is based on a handful of main suppliers in 3 different countries.The map shows where we produce and what type of products/garments in each country. Furthermore you can see what type of freight solution we used from each country. 

It is important for us to get independent control from certification bodies to ensure that our materials, products and production processes are as sustainable as they are claimed to be. For this reason, we employ a variety of certifications. We have highlighted our current certificates that we use at the moment below.",https://www.wemotoclothing.com,"{'neg': 0.004, 'neu': 0.881, 'pos': 0.115, 'compound': 0.9945}",0.9945,Positive,en
Wendy Malinovsky,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Bags', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: Wendy Malinovsky DESCRIPTION: Wendy Malinovsky is a designer with a child’s soul buried under a rainbow of colors.
Here is how one might present Wendy. Ever since she was a child, she has been in love with pink.
Probably because of her grandmother whose wardrobe was all pink.
Her palette developed as she grew up with one motto: “Good vibes only”. She has observed it in Japan, a country she is very fond of with the kawai culture, the pop colors and the fun that bring people together and make them happy.

She drew inspiration from this culture and combined it with the Moroccan craftsmanship to create the Wendy Malinovsky DNA. A touch of fun and a lot of sweetness!
She makes small productions and most of her pieces are unique, thus reinforcing the proximity between the artisan, the client, the designer and the product.

“Though my brand is very feminine for the moment, I would like to move towards something more unisex to create an entire Wendy family!” Pep, energy and vitality, discovery and creativity are the watchwords for the Wendy family. With a touch of humour and poetry.

Guaranteed freshness to bring home a little piece of blue sky!

They experienced a Scandinavian market filled with polyester and other synthetic materials and their mission became to create a brand focusing on natural fibers and sustainability, a clear design DNA and passionate values. At the time, there were no real Danish precedents and the couple had to do their own natural material sourcing, to make sure that they got the best product quality. The natural fibers also became the inspiration for the brand name, Wheat. The Danish wheat fields at summertime swaying in the wind, became the symbol of the natural fibers used and an association with a strong brand identity.

Aurélie was born in France and was rocked by stories and memories of Africa brought back by her father who has worked there for more than 20 years. It is therefore these human and cultural encounters, between Paris and Abidjan, which brought them together around common values, histories and passions. And this is what marked the starting point of this great adventure.

Wild Things,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Wild Things DESCRIPTION: The Wild Things story began in 1981, when Marie Meunier, a noted mountaineer who was the first woman to summit Aconcagua, the highest point of the Andes, and her husband John Bouchard, also an accomplished mountaineer, created their own line of lightweight, superior gear out of dissatisfaction with available products. They chose New Hampshire to set up their shop, where the rugged natural environment, big blizzards, and Mount Washington provided the perfect testing ground for new products, and there was no shortage of skilled climbers to test them. In 1983, Wild Things coined the now often used expression, ""Light is right,"" from a belief that performance gear doesn’t need to be heavy. Since then, Wild Things has earned a reputation for tough, lightweight technical outerwear, alpine-style backpacks, durable haul–bags, and innovative tactical and military clothing, and still garners the support of many professional mountain climbers today. What’s more, the brand’s functional attire designed for thermal protection and rugged luggage have been used by the United States military on an ongoing basis.

WILLIAM K. PARK,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Sustainable']","BRAND: WILLIAM K. PARK DESCRIPTION: WILLIAM K. PARK is a Ready-To-Wear Couture fashion house, founded in 2020 and based in New York, U.S.A. and Seoul, South Korea. It aims to reimagine the contemporary classics, reinterpret the world of borderless beauty that transcends inherent stereotypes or biases, and create unique processes and signatures that capture our evolving emotion of the time and hold our most personal yet most creative voice. “Veiled Darkness” is our style mantra and permanent canvas where we draw our inspirations, express a piercing yet subdued beauty from darkness, and weave our borderline sensibility into fabrics, colors, and defining details of our creations. By veiling the darkness that we use as our canvas, we hope to invoke a euphoric exit from what confines us; By veiling the conspicuous, we hope to express a kind of beauty that doesn’t hold court immediately yet delivers a harmonious and reverberating wave of emotional crescendo to where it matters.

We firmly believe that anything meaningful can’t be made without the strong foundation and understanding of time-honored craft and constantly evolving conditions of what is now. Hence, any creation we present is the very reflection of how we, as a brand, navigate the stubborn dichotomy of classical rigor vs contemporary ease; masculine vs feminine; hard vs soft; structural vs fluid.

William, founder and creative head behind WILLIAM K. PARK, was born in New York; spent his early life in South Korea and China; educated in New York and San Francisco. Crisscrossing the East and West all through his life, he is continually inspired by the creative marriage between the Eastern and Western culture.

Wo-Ma,['Womenswear'],"BRAND: Wo-Ma DESCRIPTION: Wo-Ma is a new androgynous style clothing brand, designed in London, which is  designed to empower.  

The AW24 collection is designed to empower with a strong feminine muse customer in  mind and for a fashion conscious male consumer at the same time. The line consists of  tailored shirts, tops, trousers, dresses, jumpsuits and coats. All fabrics used are 100%  natural and sustainable, no synthetic blends are involved. Attention to detail is shown  throughout this collection, the current SS24 and forthcoming SS25 collection.  

The intention of Wo-Ma is to focus on designing a timeless androgynous range of  clothing that confident consumers will identify with wearing. Attention to detail with raw  edging, contrast fabric paneling, textured layering and asymmetric block designs are  detailed throughout the range. High grade tailoring fabrics have been carefully selected  for this compact range of 15 models with a total of 34 skus. The masculine range of  fabrics combined with a colour palette of dark grey, navy and black have been chosen  for their wearability and strong consumer aesthetic identity. This androgynous unisex  style is reflected in the foundation of our brand name, Wo-Ma. The oversized nature and style throughout the collection is in place to convey a style  and mood which is completely relaxed and non constrictive. The oversized fit and shape  of garments is intentionally designed to give the wearer an enhanced feeling of comfort  with a wearable dramatic style. High quality fabrics have been sourced for this AW24  collection and we only consider 100% natural fibres. Details of fabric contrasting, raw  edging, asymmetric blocks, contrast fabric paneling have all been carefully considered  and positioned for a customer who prefers their clothes to whisper rather than shout.  

The SS24 collection has been designed with a timeless minimalist aesthetic, combining  influence from the Far East with elements of European style. Again only naturally  sustainable fibres and fabrics from cotton/silk to cotton voile and super soft linen have been considered for this collection. The garment models are enhanced with playful  details and tailored embroidery focusing on messages of freedom, love and insight for  this season. We intend to build upon this and use playful design combined with  embroidery detail as our medium to focus attention and highlight current day issues in a  memorable nature.  

Wo-Ma is a universal clothing brand designed for the non-conformist and discerning  leader who is searching for clothes that reflect their true character ethos and inner  confidence. Our objective is to design clothes that both leading women and men feel  comfortable to wear whether in their home locations or internationally in various urban  and non urban environments.  

Although this is a new brand the Wo-Ma founders have over 50 years of combined  experience having been involved in luxury retail, textile and fashion design sectors.  Claire Garabedian has an extensive background in retail having held merchandise and  buying directorships at Liberty, Harrods and Harvey Nichols. Recently she owned, ran  and sold London’s leading bespoke florist installation company, InWater.  

Whilst Head of Creative Alex Bodikian has been involved in luxury fashion and textile  design with his own luxury menswear brand and family textile mill from Huddersfield,  West Yorkshire. Alex’s extensive knowledge and background in luxury textiles and  bespoke tailoring is a key element in the development of this collection. More recently  he has been involved in the digital start up sector with branding, digital marketing, app &  eCommerce development and immersive technology software for agency Sixty7. One  could say this new venture is very much in their DNA due to their fashion experience  and involvement with starting new brands and making them a success.",https://www.wo-ma.co.uk,"{'neg': 0.011, 'neu': 0.876, 'pos': 0.113, 'compound': 0.996}",0.996,Positive,en

XD Design is a proud Dutch brand present in over 50 countries and more than 3.000 retailers worldwide. Our journey started with the creation of our design Studio in Shanghai that is run by ambitious in-house designers from all over the world.

Since then, we had over 50.000 backers on crowdfunding platforms, more than 3.000 customer interactions and thousands of followers on social media. As our following massively grew, we wanted to make sure we never lost sight of what's important to our company as well as our customers. Our products are designed to help the Modern Nomads to go about their day in a safe and functional way – enable them to move more connected and organized, regardless of distance, place or matter. 

Sustainability is also engraved in our DNA: with the utmost responsibility to our planet we use the best materials and packaging available in the market.

Xsensible,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Footwear']","BRAND: Xsensible DESCRIPTION: Xsensible is a Dutch shoe brand that draws on inspiration from far beyond our own borders. The Stretchwalker concept was developed in Japan, the country that honours traditions and knowledge focused on achieving the right balance between mind and body. The origin of our shoes is based on the principle of balance embodied in the traditional ‘Ippon-ba geta’ Japanese slipper. Inspired by the season’s trends and looks, the Xsensible collection combines fashion with decades of craftsmanship. We craft our shoes in our two state-of-the-art factory locations just outside Porto, in Portugal, in accordance with traditional methods that unite long-held values with new technologies.

Our collections may be comfortable and stylish, and they may be sold in beautifully appointed shops, but where you really stand out is with the people involved. And in our case, the people are a close-knit team of talented professionals with a passion for designing and producing excellent shoes. We are extremely proud of our team.

XUMU,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Sportswear']","BRAND: XUMU DESCRIPTION: XUMU was established in 2019 in Berlin, by two innovative designers Batuhan Dalcı and Melih Bilgin. We produce winter-oriented activewear and streetwear clothes by embracing a bold yet functional design approach and best production quality.

As a design-oriented brand, we produce specially designed products with limited quantities. This approach helps us use less electricity, less water, and less raw material.  

We use recyclable – upcyclable or already recycled (e.g., ocean waste fiber) or upcycled (e.g., production waste) materials. We never waste our unsold products by burning or throwing them away. Instead, we upcycle them. Since the day we began our journey, we have always had an attitude towards fashion, society, the environment and the world. It starts with this motto: We are not just what we wear. XUMU is the wiggle room you have, without taking things too seriously, a chirpy bravado against the status quo. 

Our “XUMU is as XUMU does” slogan highly represents this attitude. If you manage to stay lighthearted, shrewish, and be a do-gooder all at once, you are already in the XUMU community, where you are free of any judgement. 

We also believe that getting dressed is closely related to courage. You are judged by what you wear. You are defined as certain stereotypes according to your clothes. This barely turns out to be accurate. But for the brave, getting dressed could be a form of self-expression. You express yourself as you are, regardless of what others say. Regardless of what you wear, you relish to dare. 

Moving forward, we keep on inviting you to dare with us. Dare to wear things most cannot. Dare to be bold in alignment with your true nature. Dare to be judged by the people you will never see again. Dare to be yourself without any shackle society casts on you. And if you may, dare with XUMU.

DON'T LET WINTER SLOW YOU DOWN

Life doesn’t stop when winter starts. We know that because winter is in our DNA and we keep moving through it all. Yaktrax was born high in the Himalayas, inspired by a seasoned Sherpa striding confidently across slick ice and thick snow. His footwear would spark a revolutionary invention — coil technology. Since then, Yaktrax has spread across the globe to help athletes, construction crews, public service workers, soldiers, outdoorsmen, and anyone else who lives, works and plays in winter weather. Whether you walk, run or work on packed snow and ice, you can step confidently.

Named after the sure-footed Tibetan Yak, Yaktrax proudly offers a wide array of ice traction devices for your shoes in addition to other winter accessories. Whether you need the Walk for getting to the bus stop or mailbox or require extreme outdoor traction with our Summit, Yaktrax will always provide solid, predictable traction in any condition.",https://yaktrax.implus.com,"{'neg': 0.025, 'neu': 0.853, 'pos': 0.121, 'compound': 0.9413}",0.9413,Positive,en
Yan Neo,"['Womenswear', 'Bags', 'Jewelry']","BRAND: Yan Neo DESCRIPTION: Our secret is in the details  
The premium look without the premium price-tag - it’s our mission and purpose - and it’s also what every woman wants: stylish, luxurious clothing at affordable pricing, complete with must-have accessories to complement that gorgeous wardrobe. What makes Yan Neo London different is its attention to detail, its craftsmanship and fit, and especially its tailoring* which is carefully designed to flatter the female form. And Yan Neo does it all at accessible, reasonable prices. Who is Yan Neo?  
Company founder and designer Yan Neophytou has spent most of her life working in the fashion industry, from helping her family’s fashion business while growing up, and qualifying in tailoring and creative pattern-cutting before completing her Fashion BA (Hons) degree, to running a successful North London boutique for nearly ten years. It all led towards the launch of Yan Neo London in 2011. This is a carefully curated, beautifully designed wardrobe line of smart day-to-evening and executive office wear, as well as elegant leatherwear, contemporary jewellery and covetable leather bags. What distinguishes the label is its strong emphasis on tailoring*, quality and fit. And those sensible prices. 

* The secret of tailoring  
Tailoring doesn’t only apply to suits and jackets, but involves the structure of any item so that it drapes, fits and flatters the body just right. Depending on the fabric, the item of clothing and of course the shape of the woman herself, this can involve darts, seams, shoulder pads, cups, panelling and even length to govern how the fabric falls and sits on the body. Expertise in this field is what makes Yan Neo’s designs excel.

Sustainability 
What does sustainability in fashion mean? It refers to the industry’s effect on the  environment and its ability to maintain balance and avoid depleting the world’s resources.  Since fashion is, by definition, all about the novelty of new design, full sustainability is  something of a contradiction in terms, but we can and should seek ways of moving closer  towards it. That’s why we’re always working at reducing waste and the use of natural  resources such as water, petrol and power. Yan Neo London has therefore moved as much  of the process as possible into the UK, so our carbon footprint is minimal. We use eco  friendly tape, recycled tissue paper and recyclable boxes. But more than just textiles and  products, sustainability also encompasses social responsibility, so we expect our suppliers  to share our ethics about the conditions, treatment, safety and pay of their workers, and  are in no way involved with sweat shops, child labour, abuse or slavery. That’s why we know  all our suppliers and speak to them regularly. We even use existing stock fabrics so that our  suppliers don’t dye or create new fabrics just for us. It’s also why we specialise in timeless,  luxury pieces that can be kept in the wardrobe for years and worn trans-seasonally. While  the business may not yet be perfect, Yan Neo London is as sustainable as we know how to  be and, although the goal posts are constantly moving, we’ll keep working on the rest  wherever and whenever we can. 

“We’re not complacent - sustainability is always a goal. I always try to design and produce  with it in mind and always ask the right questions.”- Yan Neo

I love bringing back all of my inspirational finds and poring over them with my closest and most trusted friends. Taking such a personal approach to my designs means the Yess collection truly is a reflection of my personality. A little chaotic at times, but highly focussed and always with a little twist.

As a mother of two, I understand the need for quality fabrics and timeless finishes that won't break the bank. Items that you can cherish forever are precious because of their casual elegance. Wholesale

Zilton,"['Menswear', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Zilton DESCRIPTION: From producer of caps to fashion brand: the history of Zilton

“Our passion for fashion has been around for over a century”, says Paul Declercq, CEO of Belgian fashion brand Zilton.
This is a major exception in the world of fashion which is governed chiefly by short-term trends. Paul Declercq: “My great-grandparents started making caps in 1898 and following the death of my great-grandfather in 1917, production was taken over by his wife and two sons. Demand rose so much that in 1926 they decided to open a factory in Ardooie. In 1930, ‘City Sport’ designs were launched and my father Daniel and his cousin Godfried, the third generation, managed the factory.

During the war, production was at a low level but after the war there was an enormous boom. The sixties were more difficult because the hippies weren't really into caps; they preferred ribbons in their hair. (laughs). On the pretext of: “Not everyone wears a cap, but does wear trousers”, my father started producing trousers in 1973 as well as caps. The highest quality, a perfect fit and reliability came first and foremost. A number of years later my brother and I took over the business and in 1995 we launched ourselves under the name ‘Zilton’. From then on, things moved quickly and we soon had a full clothing collection, trousers combined with blazers, coats,  knitwear, shirts, scarves, belts.“

The family business' many years of experience in terms of materials, wear comfort, patterns and cuts, combined with the young and dynamic input of our current team have made Zilton a unique and strong Belgian brand. A solid and successful shop-in-shop concept has been developed to propose Zilton’s craftmanship in full to our fashionable customer.”

All of this has not escaped the eye of our neighbours in France and Holland. You’ll find the collection in many quality standard multibrand shops.

Following  the new trend, men dress up more, so you can expect even more creativity from us. Don’t hesitate to visit our newest website – www.zilton.com – to keep up with our  latest offers and fashion trends!

Organic and recycled fabrics are purchased from transparent, qualified European manufacturers and utilize the dead stock materials of luxury brands. With a mission to craft enduring, timeless garments ZSIGMOND paves the path of the future with the heritage of the past.

Inhale the past, exhale the future. Enamoured by folk dancing, the designer Dora found herself immersed in the world of Hungarian folklore at a young age. Over the years, her infatuation with traditional costumes grew into a profound respect, and by the age of 21, it became her mission to find a way to preserve her heritage in the fast-paced world of today. Thus, ZSIGMOND was born as her reinterpretation of Hungarian peasant culture in a modern context.",https://zsigmonddoramenswear.com,"{'neg': 0.035, 'neu': 0.901, 'pos': 0.064, 'compound': 0.5859}",0.5859,Positive,en
Zumo,"['Accessories', 'Bags', 'Bodywear', 'Eyewear', 'Footwear', 'Jewelry', 'Menswear', 'Swimwear']","BRAND: Zumo DESCRIPTION: In the late 90's the upcoming EDM nightlife demanded more extravagant, fashionable en fitted clothing for man, which was hard to find at the established brands and boutiques.

One of our founders decided to fill that gap, and our concept was born. Many of his friends (mostly active in the fashion industry) visited vintage shops in Paris and London to buy tight shirts and trousers.
With that knowledge, he started the concept.
70’s vintage items were carefully picked, washed, adapted and branded.
At first, all items were sold to friends but shortly the market grew. 
The decision to open up stores where the build fanbase could buy their favorite outfit was quickly made and in September 1997 the first store was there!

During that time it got harder to find the right vintage items.
In order to sustain the extravagant fittings of the vintage items in our collection, we started to dismantle the best ones and reproduce them at small Italian suppliers.

Jimmy Choo,"['Womenswear', 'Menswear', 'Footwear', 'Eyewear', 'Bags', 'Accessories']","BRAND: Jimmy Choo DESCRIPTION: Jimmy Choo is a leading global luxury brand with an empowered sense of glamour and a playfully daring spirit. The brand traces its roots to a bespoke shoemaker named Jimmy Choo, based in the East End of London in the early 1990s, who catered to the global jet set, including Princess Diana. The Jimmy Choo company was founded in 1996, with Mr Choo’s niece, Sandra Choi, who had been heading up design in the East End atelier, coming on board as Creative Director, a position she holds to this day. Mr Choo departed the company in 2001.

The sexy cut, fashionable design, and exceptional Italian craftsmanship struck a chord with a sophisticated clientele, and the first collection enjoyed immediate success. With a goal of creating a global luxury business, Jimmy Choo attracted outside investment and the company embarked on a significant expansion across product categories, channels and geographies.

A pioneer in the art of celebrity dressing, Jimmy Choo was among the first to bring shoes and handbags to Hollywood where the red carpet proved to be the ideal runway for the brand. Today, Jimmy Choo can be seen on style icons from celebrities to royalty, musicians to heads of state.

The brand’s reputation as a celebrity favourite helped to fuel its rapid expansion. Its iconography was further defined by the bold and dramatic advertising portraying glamorous but strong women in towering heels and luxurious handbags, captured by some of the most acclaimed fashion photographers in the world.

Retail development has been integral to the company’s strategy. The first Jimmy Choo store was opened in 1996 on Motcomb Street in London, complementing a distribution in some of the most prestigious multi-brand stores in the world. Two years later, the company expanded to the US, opening two stores in New York City and Beverly Hills. International expansion continued with Jimmy Choo securing locations in the premiere luxury shopping destinations of the world’s most prestigious cities including Sloane Street and Bond Street in London, Avenue Montaigne in Paris, Via Condotti in Rome, Madison Avenue in New York, Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, and Ginza in Tokyo.

Jimmy Choo encompasses a complete luxury accessories brand. Women’s shoes remain the core of the product offer, alongside handbags, small leather goods, scarves, sunglasses, eyewear, belts, fragrance and men’s shoes. Creative Director Sandra Choi has been with the brand since its inception in 1996 with a vision to create one of the world’s most treasured luxury brands. Jimmy Choo has a global store network encompassing more than 200 stores and is present in the most prestigious department and specialty stores worldwide. Jimmy Choo is part of the Capri Holdings Limited global fashion luxury group publicly listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker CPRI.
