## 1. Abstract
In today’s competitive global market, brands looking to grow overseas face considerable obstacles such as deciding which countries to expand into, competing with established players, building their image within the local population from the start, and more. This project analyzes the potential of the global market to provide a data-driven solution to guide strategic decision-making.

The project employs clustering approaches to identify nations where businesses with similar styling and product offerings have created a strong presence, providing insight into possible target markets. Additionally, it leverages Google Trends data to analyze brand popularity and consumer interest in various locations, allowing for a more in-depth assessment of the brand’s exposure and familiarity in similar markets.

By addressing critical questions such as:
- Which countries have the greatest potential for expansion?
- Where does competition align with the brand’s messaging?

The project provides actionable insights to decrease risk and optimize market entry strategies. This method enables brands to grow strategically and compete effectively in the global market.

## 2. Motivation
Globalization has enabled brands to expand abroad, driven by several motives:

### (1) Efficiency and Better Access
- Natural resources
- Human resources
- Financial resources

### (2) Market-Based Motives
- Expand sales
- Expand market share
- Generate better market knowledge

Fashion and leisure brands entering a new country without studying market dynamics, consumer preferences, and local competition may face costly failures, lack of regional popularity, or low visibility among potential clients. This emphasizes the importance of strategic market selection for brand success during expansion initiatives.

### Key Questions for Going Global:
- Why do I want to expand?
- Should I expand?
- Where should I expand?
- How should I expand?

These questions form a framework for companies to address before making the final decision.

Traditional methods of market analysis are resource-intensive and often lack the precision required for today’s business challenges. This underscores the need for a data-driven approach that combines market analysis with consumer insights.

### Goals of the Project:
1. Identify potential markets using clustering methods and available data.
2. Provide practical insights for worldwide expansion by assessing a brand’s appeal across regions.
3. Identify locations where brands with similar styles thrive.

This project aims to help organizations:
- Target markets strategically
- Reduce entry risks
- Improve competitive positioning

The motivation for this project stems from:
- The increasing importance of data science in decision-making processes.
- The growing demand for scalable, replicable methods to address business challenges.

### Contribution to the Fashion Industry:
This project seeks to assist brands in intelligent expansion while contributing to a broader understanding of how data science can transform market analysis. By blending clustering techniques and consumer insights, it provides a comprehensive solution to tackle globalization challenges effectively.
